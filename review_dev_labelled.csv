It's located in the parking lot in front of a mall next to a motel/hotel.  Typical looking from the outside and has all the usual jukebox and old poster and assorted memorabilia on the walls.  Nobody was dressed like the 50's (as seen in one of their ads) and while the service was alright, it was slow!  Our server had our table of 7 plus a table behind us of 8 and a couple more; she was overwhelmed. 

Looks like a lot of snowbirds go here as well as those from the hotel and workers stopping in for a bite before heading out.  The food was reasonable and was nice but to be honest, I wish I had chosen someplace else for us to go.  I wouldn't return.",0,dk5yqirSwDH7Cpp52NdhUA,1082331766789,0,1,1

Fantastic view of the surrounding mountains with large pool area for adults and children. 

Pool chairs have a flag system that you can raise for service. So no matter where you sit you never have to leave your seat for food or drink. The separate eating area is covered and the birds that beg for food are not afraid of humans. 

After a long flight this is the place to sit back, enjoy the scenery, and take in a drink or three. 

Staff is the best. Only draw back for me is like the places in Miami the gratuity is added to your check. It is a shame that businesses feel this has to be done for their workers because some ""people"" leave little or no tip for the servers. If you don't wish to tip there is always the fast food drive thru.

The rest is good as well. I've had the filet, prime rib, various appetizers, a delicious orange martini. 

Only once did I not enjoy my food. The one time I decided to order the peppercorn steak. Way too peppercorny. (is that a word? ;-)) It did live true to it's name but way too much. Couldn't taste anything else.

But wait,... I was meeting a friend in St Lawrence Market and decided to give Neo another try.  This time, the Ontario Strawberry roll was very fresh and tasty, the Orange Dark Chocolate roll wss made with very rich dark choco and match very well with orange. Both rolls were moist. The matcha latte was fine as well and wish it would be smoother in texture. Service was friendly and quick.

Then, I went back to try the Pistachio and Raspberry roll; the pistachio cream was very rich in flavour and went so well with the raspberry. It was my favourite among all the flavours I have tried. The roll was moist as well.

It couldn't fit so perfect for this review. 

Ordered a large thin pepperoni pizza. Came out to 26 bucks. Figured it must be large or really good. 

Picked it up and got home. Opened the box and it was smaller than a Costco pizza. I think to myself this must be fuckin amazing. 

Nope. The pizza was hella dry. Barely any sauce at all. I literally dipped it in bbq sauce it was so freaking dry. 

The crust was this weird texture and literally reminded me of those little garbage Tostinos frozen pizzas I hate. 

Maybe it's my fault for ordering a thin crust from a place known for their deep dish. Didn't really want a deep dish pizza when it's a brisk 109 out today.

This is definitely the best food we've had while in Scottsdale/Phoenix. The service was impeccable and the food was delicious -- words I rarely dish out for a restaurant.

For those unfamiliar with the restaurant, note that it's an older crowd. We're in our late 30s whereas most people there were 60+. This isn't reflective of their food, it's reflective of their location (I should also point out that we noticed these were some of the hippest and trendiest looking 60+ year olds we've ever seen, no joke -- lol). The restaurant itself has an adobe decor and is reasonably intimate. I'd call it dressy casual (don't wear shorts here but you can feel ok wearing nice jeans and a collared shirt if you're a gentleman).

We had a truffled, duck confit risotto with a perfectly cooked 62 degree egg on top to start. OMG. Hats off to the chef. To follow, my husband had a chicken dish and I had a scallop and sun dried tomato parpadelle pasta dish. We equally loved ours and both remarked how surprised we were of the level of quality of food. We just weren't expecting it (not the restaurant's fault, we just haven't found the food outside of Mexican in Phoenix to be that amazing).

Our server, Greg, was wonderful. Latilla would be smart to make sure to hold on to him... he's a hidden gem in the fine dining world who could easily make his mark in a high end NYC restaurant.

Anyhow, moral to the story -- if you find yourself in the Phoenix area, I'd call this restaurant a must. I only don't give it 5 stars because I've traveled around the world and eaten at so many really amazing restaurants. This sincerely stacks up as a 4 star against them all, which I think is a huge compliment to the Latilla. If I was rating just for the Phoenix area, it would be a 5 star hands down. So go eat there. It's yummy. :)",0,TdYJqGeNjI-BmgXHQRMI4g,77309421985,9,0,0

We had the tuna tartare which was fresh and flavourful.  My wife had the prawn pasta which she enjoyed.  I had a steak which was well cooked with a delicious baked potato.

The only downside to the experience was the service.  I didn't receive a steak knife for my dinner.  Our plates weren't cleared away until our next dish arrived, which meant we sat with empty plates in front of us for 10-15 minutes.

We found out after speaking with our server that two staff members hadn't shown up for work which gave everybody else more tables.  This is obviously not the fault of the staff, but it slightly tarnished the food experience.  Our server was literally out of breath from running around.

The place already had a couple of tables going and some food bloggers filming at the open kitchen. You can see the chefs working from every table in the restaurant but if you want to chat with the chefs ask for a seat at the open kitchen area. 

The 2 of us had different courses with different wine pairings. I started with an amuse bouche, followed by popcorn soup, raw fish salad, kangaroo, quail and an ice cream lollipop.   My husband had lamb which was a little overdone and they replaced this immediately with some fabulous veal cheeks and an extra wine paring
The outstanding courses were the veal cheeks, kangaroo, quail and a raw fish salad.  

The wine parings were good and well synchronized with the food, no waiting and good sized pours.  

OK  what is with the bread???    or should I say lack of bread.   You have to beg for it.  ""Well we don't really DO bread but if you are prepared to wait you can have some""  OK the bread is worth waiting for.  Its not like any bread I have had before, its sort of frenchie, cakey, fried in animal fat or lard, but it is GOOD.  You need the bread to soak up all the yummy sauces. 

The staff were friendly but could have spent an extra minute with us to explain the dishes in greater detail and why the wines were paired with it .   Staff were knowledgeable about the wines.

Parking --  easy to find right under the restaurant follow the signs for POSH

Okay, so weekend dinner is $28.99, weekday dinner is $23.99, plus tax. I'm not exactly sure how much it is for lunch, but I recall seeing a sign that it was around $15 for all you can eat. It sounds pretty expensive, cause I mean, you COULD go for sushi for this price, which is actually very true, but I don't think you could get freshly made deep fried lobster with great sauce and however much lobster you want for that price.

I usually go to Congee Queen or other restaurants to pay $20+ for a lobster yee mein, and here, the staff were super friendly and even brought it to our table, or if there weren't any outside (as business was a little slow), said that we could just order it and they would bring it to our table. The plates were all promptly changed, and we had drinks almost immediately, whenever we ordered. There was no surcharge for any soft drink. This place is still relatively new, so I totally understand if they were trying to make a good impression on their customers. 

The sushi didn't quite appeal to me, nor did any of the cold mussels, crab legs, shrimp and clams. I DID, however appreciate the mussels that were stir fried in black bean sauce. The food wasn't super hot, but the lobster was definitely really good. I also enjoyed how they made the peking duck on a trolley and served it to the tables. I would go out to dim sum restaurants and pay $160 for a peking duck lobster meal and find that the peking duck doesn't have meat on it or isn't cooked properly. The peking duck here, is actually cooked properly - (a little longer than needed though, so it's not as juicy) and it has meat in it. I didn't have to add anything myself and it was all handmade (that's why the skin of the peking duck wrap is a little different). 

For a Chinese buffet, I felt like it was edible as a Chinese person. Many of the Chinese buffets like Mandarin taste terrible to me. I would say, that it is buffet standard food, so don't expect it to be like those sit-down restaurants with amazing quality (the only thing amazing was really the lobster, and the black bean clams when it is freshly brought out). I could tell that it's hard to make the food super hot all the time as it's still a relatively new place, but I think the staff are really trying to listen to their customers and make it a good experience. Secondly, for all you can eat lobster and for a free meal to the birthday person, I definitely had a good and non expensive experience here.

Product: My husband and I ordered a hot fudge sundae and a dipped cone from the DQ drive thru. His hot fudge sundae came exactly the way it was supposed, however, when the drive thru rep handed us my order, she gave me a plain vanilla cone. I had advised that it was supposed to be dipped. After about a minute or so, she handed me my dipped cone. Now, I have been to this Dairy Queen several times and what was handed me was a vanilla cone with a very very very thin layer of chocolate around the ice cream (please see picture). I have ordered this item in the past and never has the chocolate looked like that. Yes, I'm complaining about the amount of chocolate that was used on my cone, but specifically the quality and presentation is what I really had a problem with. 

Service: I went into the DQ and politely asked to speak with someone. When the manager approached me I advised that I was a bit dissatisfied with the end result. He stated, ""The chocolate is too hot and that's why it looks like that on the ice cream"". There was no apology, and in fact, I'm a bit sad at the way he made me feel as if I was bothering him. I asked just for a new plain vanilla cone instead. As he walked away to make it, he looked over his shoulder and said, ""You can throw that one away"". I did. He came back and handed me a plain cone and said nothing. At this point, I was so surprised with the lack of customer service that I took the cone and walked out. There was no sincerity or apology. Not that I was looking for that, but I do expect to be treated at least somewhat nicely as I was not irate or even mad about the situation until the manager told me to throw my original order away. In addition, there was no refund for the difference. I know we're talking about small change here, but being the manager he should have at least refunded me for the difference. 

I understand they were busy, but I can't understand being treated like a bother. Although this place is just a few blocks away from me, I would rather go out of my way for ice cream than ever go here again.",2,d_DPeh-LX77efXj6fiMLhw,1365799604161,34,1,1

My company held a corporate event here, taking over most if not all of the driving ranges for an evening. The different ""lanes"" on the driving range all had high-top tables or sofas and coffee tables (a better choice for me to sit and chat with others, as I don't golf much, so thanks for putting comfortable furniture out there!), patio heaters and drink service. The golfers in our group really enjoyed it. Our group also had buffet food service, which they don't have a lot of room to set up near the driving ranges, but it mostly worked. My only gripe is our group drink tickets didn't include the wine I wanted and even if I offered to trade all three drink tickets for one glass of what I wanted, they wouldn't do it though that would've worked out financially to their advantage.",2,7RdeSOlDzmNGOks-8CFR9Q,652835030174,35,1,1

I came here twice, although there weren't a ton of seats, the service was awesome and quite fast. They have 15 main items with their green tea and black sesame soft serve specialty and quite a few others items listed on the side (e.g. creme brulee). 

I personally am not a big fan of Black Sesame, but the people working there gave me a great tip before I ordered and let me know that the Black Sesame is sweeter and the green tea along was quite bitter, so I decided to go with the twist option in a cone ($5.50). I'm super glad I went with this option, because trying the green tea alone, it was indeed quite bitter. The ice cream looked really delicious to eat, but tasting it, the texture of the ice cream was indeed soft serve and tasty, but it wasn't anything SUPER special to me. Something I think was mixing in the texture is the creaminess of the soft serve (not sure if it's compatible with the matcha and black sesame), though I did taste more creaminess in the black sesame than the matcha. Also, I really wonder if the matcha can be made in a way where it's not bitter and yet still tastes good - I also found this a problem with one of the green tea softserves in Downttown Toronto. 

The second time I came, I tried the Kinako Azuki Shiratama soft serve mix for $7. This included sprinkled brown sugar, red bean and mochi. I liked the touch of brown sugar, felt indifferent about the red bean option, and was quite disappointed with the mochi. The mochi wasn't super soft and it didn't have a filling. Added in into the ice cream, it tasted like a blob of white flour with no taste and is slightly sticky for the texture of the mochi. I think if they did smaller pieces of mochi, it would be much better. In addition, maybe a little more icing sugar wrapped around the smaller pieces of mochi would have helped.",3,jlu4CztcSxrKx56ba1a5AQ,936302883933,45,1,1

We stumbled upon this little gem and managed to score a  seat at the bar on a Saturday night. The staff was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. 

We started off with the hummus and roasted cauliflower with house chips, which was succulent. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection and had a wonderful seasoning. Next we had the roasted goat cheese with beets which was also delicious. The sweetness of the beets against the goat cheese made for a pleasant contrast. Finally the osso buco with mushrooms and risotto! I was surprised when one of the staff members brought me a steak knife.. but I never touched it. The meat fell off the bone and melted in your mouth.

In its defense however this is no regular fuel depot. This place has gambling (duh), a post office, and a car wash, oil change, smog, and in the Summer (sometimes) shaved ice.

Everything my family and I have eaten here has been delicious, they LOVE the carne asada fries! I LOVE the ""little-donkeys"" and the ""cheese sandwiches"" so to speak.

We used to go here much more often, however ordering for a large family takes the one man show quite a while to make (and time IS of the essence these days right?) as well as the biggest blow of all to me... he only accepts CA$H now... no more debit, no more credit. I don't know about you, but even in this gambling town I pretty much don't carry any cash (FYI would be pickpockets/thieves).

So, if you are flush with cash, have lots of time, and want really good food to go, this is a great place to get it from.

PS- the salsa, when he says hot is hot... he means it. My tabasco drinking days are behind me, however I can rest assured telling you, their red salsa is so hot, it is almost unpleasant to eat it on your food.

JJ's Red Hots is a fast casual restaurant for Hot dog, sausage and chili lovers.  Oh yeah, they also have salads but if you come here for a salad without trying the dogs first, there's something wrong.

I thought that when I ordered, they would take an already cooked dog and just add my desired toppings but no you get a freshly cooked dog which is why it takes a little longer.  They have various names for their dogs with various toppings including the standard, ketchup, mustard, relish, onions, chili and more.  And put them in any combo.

But it's not the toppings that stand out, it's the dog itself.  They are cooked long enough to give them a nice brown color and a great smoky flavor.  Toppings for the Carolina and Jersey dogs were good.  For the Jersey dog, I should have added some hot sauce to cut the sweetness of the relish a bit.  But otherwise it was quite tasty.

If you order the combo, your meal comes with a drink and your choice of 4 sides.  I went with the onion rings which were thin and had a nice kick to them.

They also sell beer, both bottled and local drafts and have a few wine selections.  

Around the restaurant, the decor is black and red.  There is an old drum set turned into a light fixture in the dining room.  There's 2 TV's, several booths, tables and a 12 seater pub table.  They also have a small patio out back and the deck on top of the restaurant.   The staff is super friendly here and seemed to go out of their way to help you understand the menu and bring you things that you may have forgotten, like napkins.

In a space that has been so many restaurants in a short time, I think this might be the one that sticks around for a while.  At least I hope they do!",4,SlgpAnj2gQd44EM_Uq6DkQ,1022202225086,66,0,0

Checked out their 2 for 20 menu, even with having low expectations about it my girlfriend and i skipped it and went for the main menu. I haven't been to a chili's in years and couldnt figure out the stupid ass menu. Honestly, very few pictures and some entrees had 0 description in one area, listed again on another page or in the little side menu planted on the tables. Given ample time I perhaps could have made an educated choice but our waitress was rushing/borderline harassing us.
As soon as we sat down she asked if we were ready to order, BEFORE getting our drinks, really? Who does that...
She came around 3 times in the next 5 minutes and asked ""Have you decided yet? -- Did you guys pick on something? -- Know what you want now?""

Um. If customers have their noses planted in the menu and they arent looking up at all, NO THEYRE NOT READY

As a result I ordered a classic, cheese steak, cant screw that up right?

Food
It sucks. It fucking sucks! One-star level of food here, no hyperbole. (Well, maybe a little.)

Now, I am no goddamn expert on barbecue (I have only made pilgrimages to Austin, KC, Memphis, and Nashville for barbacoa though, and actually saw firsthand how all originally derived in a Taíno reserve), but what I have been served here at Lucille's was simply not good food. 

Did not taste good, did not look good; made me want to strive to become vegan. If I were forced to eat all of my meat exclusively from Lucille's, or of a Lucille-like quality, I would become vegan. No bullshit. I would basically become Morrissey. 

Service
The one waiter we had did not (a) know what was it that came with the largest pre-packaged combo on their own menu -- like no shit ... had no clue at all -- ; and (b) did not bring everything that was supposed to come with the combo from their very own menu after studying it at fucking length! Sucks.

Ambiance
I have been to Heavy Metal concerts that were kinder to my hearing. And I have also been to private invite events at Wynn fucking Resorts that had less pretentious yuppies than Lucille's in The District at GVR, Henderson, NV, U.S.A.. 

Dude, turn down the fucking volumes on those goddamn amps in the bar; this is not an arena or Lollapalooza. It is a fucking restaurant!

Epilogue
Overpriced. And it sucks. The holy duo for I-won't-be-caught-dead-in-this-shithole-again for me. That is just me; this might be the greatest eats you have ever had in your life for you though. We are all different, after all. - E

I say this, even after we had a misunderstanding with the restaurant and the front counter of the Orleans. But.... it really wasn't the restaurant's fault. Allow me to explain, we were given a food comp from The Orleans for $50. This was part of the hotel package that we received. We had put down a cash deposit for our stay... we did not use a credit card for this trip. Well, when we tried to use our food credit at the restaurant, the restaurant initially tried to charge it to the room.  After we had already departed from the restaurant, the restaurant realized that because there was no credit card on file, they could not charge it to the room so they called the front desk. An employee at the front desk who really did not know her job too well, told them that they had to figure it out so the employee of the restaurant actually called the hotel room, at 2 a.m! So both employees at this point had made mistakes, but the mistakes were each based on the fact that there are not proper procedures in place for when a guest checks in with cash as a deposit, and is receiving a comp. Eventually, after my wife spoke to a more well-versed employee at the front counter the entire situation was figured out. The restaurant, apologized for the employee calling the room at such a late hour, the restaurant offered us a free dinner for the misunderstanding, and the server actually came to our table personally, and apologized profusely.  The manager on duty was very polite and very accommodating to us. And we were very thankful to him.

We have come here a few times, and I found the experience to be consistently positive, but not overwhelmingly so. 

Pros of my experiences include good prices, fast service, free soup and dessert if you purchase a full meal over a certain threshold, and no MSG in the food.

Cons include the tacky decor, the clamouring service (waitresses are at your table for all of five seconds to toss food on your table, but this is typical of dim sum places), and the lack of organization. We tried to order the lotus root with glutinous rice but were told that the chef only makes it when he feels like it. 

Since the food is cooked with no MSG, less salt, and less oil, there are some reductions in taste, but these reductions are not highly noticeable. Besides dim sum I like ordering the $37 bass special, it is a three-course meal for three with a delicious soup with noodles, three options for the main, and a vegetable dish.

We ordered one of their Family Packs - 4 pieces of halibut, 2 orders of fries, 1 order of onion rings, 1 large gravy, and 1 large coleslaw. On this day, it was 39.95, 1.00 off because they weren't serving onion rings. I guess their fryers were too busy. We paid and got a number in the queue. Despite the fifteen or so orders ahead of us, they got the foods out pretty quickly. I could see each piece of fish being battered and dipped in ther fryer and the fries being done in another fryer. They had a good system going to manage the rush.

I observed all the orders, including ours, being boxed, wrapped, labeled, and boxed again. Very neat. Nice touch.

The fish was still crispy when we got back home. It had a nice light batter. The fries weren't as crispy, maybe from being wrapped too well, allowing it to sweat. They were still good. The gravy was thick and a little on the salty side. It could probably have been fixed with a little hot water. The coleslaw was creamy, the way I like it.

My girlfriend and I booked a table for Saturday night as part of a nice getaway to Montreal for the weekend. As we were warned about the popularity of the place, we booked several days in advance. I should have seen the red flag in the first place when someone from the restaurant called 90 minutes before the reserved time to ask if ""we were still willing to go on with the reservation"" (they didn't say they'd call to confirm when we originally booked). I was a little puzzled but did not think much of that at the moment.

We entered the restaurant right on time only to find no one welcoming us. No smile and ""I'll be with you shourtly either"": we were instead left waiting in the minuscule bar area for five minutes while being pushed by busy waiters before someone approached us and opened us with an ""Aaah, ok"" after I stated we had a reservation. Said waitress then goes away for another two minutes before a different employee leads us to our ""table"".

The table was outside, which no one alerted us too during the reservation process. It was not even a wooden table like the rest of the restaurant had, but a small, short, uneven-legged, metallic *garden* table covered in towels (yes, towels) as smaller objects would otherwise fall between its pierced surface. No word of apology or checking the table was ok for us, or reason why it was different from all the others was uttered at all. It took us a minute to realize it was places so that it was impossible to read the (French-only) menu on the blackboard while seated: we had to stand up and walk ten steps to contemplate it. No wine menu was present on the blackboard.

At that point, I thought back at the confirmation call and it all made sense to me: they were fully booked and just wanted to get rid of the English-speaking Yankees to make room for a better-connected party: as we confirmed the reservation, rather than decline the late bookers they just gave them our table and places us on a add-on, preposterous arrangement whose most immediate relative is the children table of your family wedding. A quick look at Yelp reviews from my iPhone confirmed this was exactly the way Joe Beef does business: you stay classy, Joe Beef.

We should have left the place at once, but we went on to order an entree and a main course (no wine, as there was no wine menu in sight nor we were asked if we'd like some by an overly hurried waiter). The food came in (rice with beef Indian way, zucchini flowers, veau liver and salmon a la Provencale) and was good in an absolute sense but not remotely excellent or consistent with the prices Joe Beef asks (the two of us paid $120 with no dessert and wine).

The climax was as another waitress approached my gf with the line:""Don't you feel like in Italy with this small, romatic table?"". The girlfriend, actually being a citizen of Italy, where such a treatment at a restaurant is unheard of, could not help responding with a dry:""Not really"". Surely enough, word came to our designated waiter we did not like the towel-covered table and he came in offering the usual free dessert you can read about in so may Yelp reviews. He did so in a hurried, annoyed way and did not accompany it with the slightest hint of an apology. We turned the cake (of his choice) down and proceeded to pay and not let the unfortunate incident of walking into this establishment ruining our night any longer.

I have the utmost respect of anyone working in the restaurant business and the highest admiration for the daily miracle most of them make happen in the face of countless logistic and financial obstacles and risks, in order to make a living for themselves but also to put a smile on the faces of their guests, from whence comes, I believe, their professional realization. For this very reason, it deeply saddens me that the restaurant business is also populated by the likes of Joe Beef, which, in the light of all the similar experiences here, is obviously cashing in some early success by reguarly ripping off and disappointing their guests, especially the new ones. In the age of Yelp, this is a strategy for meeting one's demise, a fate that I believe will touch this establishment sooner than later. In the meantime, don't do yourself a disservice by believing your travel guide, and steer away from 2491 St. Catherine Ouest: I am sure you'll find dinner spots more deserving of your money and, above all, trust.",2,uvOhHLV_4gigBHlw4_7U5Q,154618844028,85,1,1

I am always on the search for a good steak and Charlotte has plenty of ""ruth-like"" places where you order a ridiculously expensive steak and then share a couple sides.  But somehow out of all the places I always return to my first love.  

I just simply love the food here.  The steak just has NOT been beat in my opinion.  I always get the filet and it always melts in my mouth and I can always cut it with a butter knife or fork.  It is tender, it is juicy, it requires no additional seasoning, it is PERFECT.

The sides not just compliments to the meal, they are essential and just as good as the main dish.  I love their mashed potatoes (regular or sweet), their broccoli au gratin is amazing, and you can close your eyes and point to any of the salads listed and you will be satisfied.  

I haven't tried all of the desserts but their bread pudding makes me want to jump for joy.  Food excites me.  It's weird.  I know.

This last visit to Ruth's was for a special celebration and I didn't think the quality of service was up to par.  They seemed rushed and our server seemed to go missing quite frequently.  They just didn't have that ""it"" factor this time for some reason.  It was the day after Christmas so maybe that is why...I don't know.  Normally I walk in and am greeted as if I was their special guest and I leave feeling like I was treated like royalty.  This time, not so much.  However, I don't care because the food was all that and then some.  I would still return again and again because they just do it right!!

If anyone has suggestions on a place they have been that tops this steak I want to hear about it!  Don't tell me the Palm, Flemmings, Sullivan's  or Del Friscoes.  I have compared all of those places.

At the very beginning when I went to check in, you initially told me that instead of the 5 nights that had been reserved, there was only 1 night reserved. I had to get out of line, ask my boss for the confirmation email, then wait in line for 45 minutes. When I got to the front, you shut down several of the check-in desks so there was only one open to the general public. When I explained that I had a 5 night reservation, your check-in agent gave me attitude. Finally, she went and got a manager, who explained that while there was a 5 night reservation, only 1 night was paid for. That was fine, and should have been explained before I had to go wait in line and listen to the agent tell me that I didn't know what I was talking about. 

When the time came for me to utilize the cashier, he told me that I needed ID, which I'd left in my purse in one of the ballrooms. This was in spite of the fact that the machines were quite willing to take my bills, but for some reason breaking them down into 10's by the cashier required ID.

On my second-to-last night at Paris, I went to take a shower. I grabbed the top wash rag that had been nicely folded and supplied by housekeeping earlier that day. When I got under the shower head and opened the wash rag to add shower gel, I found someone's fake eyelash stuck to the wash rag. So gross.

The following evening, I came back to my room after a long day at a conference only to find that housekeeping had apparently been snacking in my room since they dropped some type of nut on the floor next to the bed. 

I tweeted a photo of the nuts on the floor to Paris, but all they did was offer to send housekeeping up the next morning. I'd cleaned up the nuts the evening I found them, and I find it appalling that they didn't do anything to try to actually make the situation right for me. 

I would strongly suggest staying away from this hotel.",12,IDGjnWQAiycFc3XJRGCZAg,1657857393597,94,1,1

We had PM pizza before at a super bowl party and thought the selection was great.  We decided to check out a location near us a couple weeks ago on a Wednesday.  We thought we did not need to call ahead, I mean how long could it take to just throw some toppings on a pizza to hand to us to take home to bake??  Well we were wrong, it took nearly 25-30 minutes just to wait for one pizza.  They were clearly understaffed and busy that night, hopefully it will not take this long again, but to take as long as it does to pick up a cooked pizza is not the way to do things Papa Muphy's!

On to the pizza.  We got a large spicy fennel sausage gourmet delite pizza.  This pizza is a thin crust pizza with garlic sauce, spicy sausage, tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, and parmesan.  The aroma in the house when cooking this pizza was fabulous.  It only took about 15 or so minutes to bake.  We really liked the flavor of this one and would get it again.

I then went to the counter and asked the guys if bought something here and did not buy a drink from her could I still sit there? They said yes of course! 

So I went back and sat down, she came over and told me unless I was buying something from her that I had to leave. I said that is not true she huffed and puffed and wanted to know who said that, after telling her she went over and through a fit with the boys.

Beverage: PREVIOUSLY - This place had tasteless food, (some of it tasted like they had just opened frozen veggie packets & added some sauce), the worst gin & tonic I've ever had in their previous location off of Yonge street.

PRESENT- Looks like they have reinvented themselves! Their G&T was among the best I've had.
Food & service: The food was freshly prepared, well spiced, standard North Indian & Punjabi fare. It was quite good. They have an interesting south Indian Madras Paneer which is very tasty & extremely spicy (you can request that they tone it down as it can become unpleasant after a few mouthfuls) which goes well with rice.

As someone with New Orleans roots who's also  lived abroad in China, I was super excited to try to the Gumbo Ramen as well as experience this unique Cajun Asian Fusion. We were sat immediately by the hostess around 8:30, but after some obvious confused discussion between the hostess and servers of who would take our table, we still did not see the server (Chloe) until about 10 minutes later. This late response to our table was indicative of how lackluster our entire eating experience would turn out to be. After placing our drink and appetizer orders, it seemed to take forever for anything to arrive to our table. I didn't realize how long our appetizers (kale salad and tuna roll)  took until I checked the Snapchat picture* that I took upon arrival at Wu's and saw that 30 minutes had passed. I could excuse the appetizer wait if it wasn't for the fact that none of the main course food was actually good- the Galbi short ribs were chewy and under seasoned with the only taste coming from the dry rub on top; the ramen was also flavorless probably due to the fact that it did not have enough gumbo broth in the bowl, and the undercooked nature of the noodles made them soak up what little broth was in the bowl. Throughout this time Chloe was also grossly inattentive to our table- water was not refilled, old plates not removed, etc. And after our main course was cleared (by someone else), she arrived to our table with our check in hand (!!) before asking if we even wanted the dessert that comes with the restaurant week menu (I will note that the Apple Pie Egg Rolls are AMAZINGGG, can't say the same for the fried air pockets they call beignets.) As a former server, I try to be understanding of people having bad days, etc. but Chloe's demeanor and conversational, cheery attentive nature to the other high top tables surrounding us showed that we were the only customers she did want to be bothered with.
I was wholly disappointed by the entire experience, especially since I had been anticipating dining at Wu's. Definitely not worth the $35/person restaurant week price. This experience is even more disheartening for my girlfriend, who is a local Chef de Cuisine at a Charlotte restaurant that also participates in Queen City Feast; and happens to be familiar with the Bottle Cap Group and Chef Troy.

Later in the meal, as my waiter was making a beeline for my table with a pitcher of water, she intercepted my table with a different pitcher at the last second and poured it instead. My waiter stood there sort of surprised for a second and muttered ""Thanks."" It's weird occurrences of this sort that add so much more to the dining experience.

I was on the verge of selecting a more conventional lunch items like a pork sandwich or a burger when I noted a separate menu section at the bottom for knife n' fork biscuits. I selected one called ""The Fisher"", which featured two delectable biscuit halves with pan-fried trout cakes served over a remoulade. Everything about this part of the plate rocked my socks. I opted to have this served with potatoes, which came with some sort of bell-peppery salsa.

Buffet at The Palms particularly busy with a broad mix of patrons including Body Builders, Locals and tourists in town to watch the Final Four.

Currently celebrating Passover with a variety of traditional Jewish dishes in addition to the 'usual' items described as a ""celebration of All-You-Can-Eat,"" seven stations spread over a sizable footprint divided by cooking method and concept, it was just prior to 6:00pm that three guests arrived before the rush and found quick seating at a banquet near ""World Pan,"" everyone taking a moment to peruse the choices and plate number one comprised of Walnut Prawns every bit as good as what one will find on Spring Mountain Road plus spicy Noodles and respectable General Tso's Chicken.

Again impressed by such a radical departure from Station Casinos' Feast brand of Buffet, everything from the décor to individual servings rivaling the standard set by Caesars' Bacchanal or Cosmo's Wicked Spoon, it was working with small portions that plates two and three took a look at several of the  Passover options plus a Dinner Roll and surprisingly light French Macarons, the Chopped Liver rich and creamy while Matzo Brei, Soup and Stuffing were all pleasant, though limited personal experience prevents comment as to whether others would think they were great.

Executed under the direction of Chef Joseph Kudrak, his time with Station Casinos at Red Rock earning him a role overseeing Palms Casino Resort as a whole, it was with plate four that the first misfire of the evening arrived in the form of watery Lasagna with overly sweet Sauce, the Stromboli and smoked Ratatouille a far better example of A.Y.C.E.'s Italian offerings while the French Onion Soup topped in gooey Cheese is also worth a taste.

Taking a look at the Roastery plus Smoke & Fire next, sliced-to-order Roast Beef faring better than chewy smoked Brisket while Ribs, Turkey and Morrocan Lamb Stew were all better than one might ever expect at a Buffet, those avoiding Meat will be happy to know that Herb Roasted Cauliflower, Mushroom Quesadillas and Cornbread are all very good while the layered pan of Jack Fruit Enchiladas may just be the best savory item on the whole Buffet. 

Priced at just $21.99 for Dinner, Station's Boarding Pass saving each guest $4, Dessert offers a whole island of items that shifts from morning to evening, the aforementioned Macarons as good as what is offered at the end of a meal at Le Cirque while miniature Carrot Cake, Cheesecake Parfaits, Lemon Meringue Tarts and Vegan Coconut Cookies all stand out amongst a collection that even goes so far as to account for dietary restrictions such as Sugar or Gluten Free.

Wrapping up with made-to-order Cookie Sandwiches plus three large-format Desserts, the Apple Cobbler and Fudge Brownie both nice landing pads for Soft Serve plus a variety of toppings, it warrants repeating that no visit to A.Y.C.E. should end without a heaping scoop of Cinnamon Roll Bread Pudding plus or minus Ice Cream, Gelato or Caramel because save for *perhaps* what is offered at The Kitchen at Atomic there is none better in Sin City...and theirs is $8 a slice.

We ordered guacamole, and chips and salsa to start off. The salsa was really good and gave us time to check out the menu. 

We had ordered drinks which took around 15-20 minutes to arrive. They were simple drinks; beer, vodka soda, gin soda, etcetera. 

The server said he'd explain the menu eventually but never really got around to it. 

I ordered chilaquiles and added chicken to them (which is very common in the original dish), the chicken came separate and seemed to have been dipped in oil. I still threw it on the hot pan that contained the chilaquiles and mixed them together (which should've been done in the kitchen, I think), and proceeded to eat. They were okay, nothing remarkable. 

At the end, we got the check all together for the group. I guess the rush did let the server have separate tabs(?).  Surprisingly, they had already added the ""gratuity"" in the check and the server forgot to mention it.

Olive Garden? Check. Cheesecake Factory? Duh! What's this? THE Gordon Ramsay has a burger place? I HAVE to check it out!

Just a general tip for anyone going out to eat for supper... try to be at the location before 5pm. After this time, you'll have to wait in a line and everything will be crazy busy.

SO! This was the first restaurant my group & I ate at after a LOOOOOONG day of flights and travel. We get there, and the restaurant isn't busy. We go up to the hostesses and ask for a table for 3. We got seated by a blonde girl who DEFINITELY had some sass going.

That said, our waitress was incredible. She knew the menu, she knew the cocktails, she knew what to recommend based on our tastes... she was a breath of fresh air! The cocktails we ordered were quite good and fresh.

We started off  by sharing a plate of onion rings and o... m... g... They ruined onion rings for me. I will NEVER be able to find onion rings THAT good anywhere else. They were crispy and fresh with delicious seasoning and sauces. To die for.

I had a veggie burger. I see you rolling your eyes at me. I'm no vegan... and trust me I love my meat... but after 12 hrs of travel, I needed something lighter on the stomach. Let me tell YOU after trying this burger I'm seriously considering the vegetarian life. It was tasty and plentiful, I was full after eating it.

The only downer? The burger menu literally is just that one your plate - the burger. No sides or beverage included :/ so YA the place is a little expensive but I've noticed most Vegas places are. Unless you go to mcdonalds o.O

Reservations were at 1:00, but because of no traffic we arrived nearly 30 minutes early, so we were told to wait in line.

We were seated about the time of our original reservation, not in the main room of the restaurant, but in the back, with views of Caesar's Palace and the Strip, not the kitchen, so my mother-in-law was disappointed.

I began my meal with the Smoked Golden Beets Salad, and it was superb. It seemed to be the perfect temperature, cool, but not cold. The beets were flavorful and cooked to perfection, and the pistachio granola provided a welcome crunch. Everything tasted FRESH.

For my main I think l made a mistake by trying the Margherita Pizza, so as to compare it with my favorite pizza restaurant. While everything was again fresh, and looked beautiful, the crust was not very flavorful, and the tomatoes were mostly tasteless as well. It is February, and I guess decent tomatoes are hard to come by. 

I tried the Hells Kitchen IPA by Stone Brewing to go along with my pizza and enjoyed it.

Dessert was divine. I think it was called Pineapple Carpaccio. The dry ice provided quite the show, but the thin ribbons of cool sliced pineapple and coconut sorbet were the star, and not too sweet. 

I tasted the Pan Seared Scallops and Lobster Risotto my dining companions ordered and both were delicious. I would like to add that I think the lunch menu is different from the dinner menu.

When we left the restaurant at 2:00 on a weekday afternoon there was no line to get in.

 As my mother-in-law uses a walker we parked at Caesars valet. From there it was a short walk to the restaurant. Otherwise parking in the hotel garage is more of a schlep.

I would expect nothing but the best food from a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, and except for the pizza I tried, that is what I got.

I live the lazy Keto life, but we eat out a lot because we travel. I've had to figure out how to eat at restaurants without everything being wrapped in soggy, warm lettuce.
This night, we got the Onion ring poutine. I ate around the fries and rings (my husband was happy to eat them for me) and I got the roast dip sandwich, no bread. It wasn't pretty (I've kind of given up on pretty due to Keto) but it was amazing! So much flavor and that, coupled with my side order switched out for a Caesar salad for my side, made my belly very happy. Hubbie got the meatloaf and was very satisfied.
Love this place... although watch where you sit, they have some big windows and the sun can be brutal coming in through the ones without shades.

The service is also top-notch, and it's very apparent that ownership and management care about providing the best service possible. I've recommended this place to tourists, people I know who live close by, and friends and family who live on the other side of town. EVERY person I've sent to Fuzzy's has thanked me for sending them here and proving their New Mexican food addiction! The prices are reasonable, the service is excellent, and you can taste the quality of their ingredients in every bite. There aren't too many Mexican places in town that you can say that about... They also don't skimp on guacamole, sour cream, and all the ""extras"" that many of us can't live without. The atmosphere is also worth noting, as there are TVs throughout the establishment along with several beers on tap. 

If you become a regular visitor here -- and I guarantee you will after trying this place -- I recommend getting their 32-ounce souvenir cup, which allows you a soda, tea or juice refill on every visit for just $1.25. You should also set a reminder on your phone to come on Tuesdays, as chicken tacos, pork tacos and ground beef tacos are just $1 each. The parking lot is PACKED on Tuesdays from about 11:30-1:30, however, especially with Pizza Rev next door having $6 individual pizzas the same day (normal price $8). So if you plan to come on Tuesdays, avoid the lunch crowd because the line can be out the door.  You may also have to park on the side street behind the optometrist and pizza place. The staff at Fuzzy's is extremely quick and efficient, though, so don't turn around if you see a long line here.

I didn't pay for it, but apparently it's extremely cheap.  And thus - really popular!

The design and architecture is absolutely a high five! The husband and wife design-build team made the space(s) comfortable and simple, paid great attention to detail with an overall feeling of awesomeness! 

Now back to why our last experience was just simply terrible. It is very difficult to enjoy oneself when he is exposed to a waitress with a complete attitude. No matter how successful your business is, the waitress does not need to introduce herself with a shitty/cocky attitude, act annoyed when asked a question from the menu and completely inconvenienced when asked to fill up our drinks (more money in their pockets for goodness sakes). This turned all of us off completely. From that point forward, it was difficult to enjoy the environment and/or food (that was okay). Even though we were embarrassed our friends had to experience this, we were thankful they were there conversing with us or we would have simply walked out.

We will probably go back but not anytime soon. We definitely will not invite friends with us next time, nor feel when were out and about having conversations with others, to talk the place up with compliments. 

I hope the owners and staff keep their heads on straight and realize no matter how well or poorly they are doing, there ultimate goal is to satisfy the people that are willing to dine there.

Prices were about what you'd expect.  The soup (which we didn't try) was quite a bit more expensive than what we usually pay, but the entrees were a little less, so I guess it evens out.

my fiancé and I have been dying to try this place out but moved from downtown to gates mills so it's quite a (well worth it) hike. we got all of the kimichi balls, pork and chicken bao and the spicy pork dumplings to start. all absolutely divine. I cannot believe the reviews saying that the bao are undersized. that is absolutely NOT the case. i think the bao is comparable to one of the yummiest bao restaurants we've been to, Baoburg, when we lived in NYC. to drink, my fiancé got Miss O and I got the raspberry sake. omg, delicious! for our entrees, I got the shoyu ramen and my fiancé got the fried chicken. again, what's with the reviews saying it's small? this is japanese fusion food, not an asian buffet. while I loved the ramen, I will say there was not enough chicken and the broth was rather tasteless unless doused with chili oil, but still IONS better than garbage noodlecat and otani noodle. 

we also took my parents here last sunday after the flea for brunch and they LOVED it. we got the vegan & pork jeon (korean pancakes) and they were scrumptious. my dad is not exactly an ""out of the box"" type of eater and he adored this place. him and my fiancé got the pork chop as their entree and I got the spicy miso ramen and my mom got he shoyu ramen. the spicy miso ramen was absolutely delicious and super super flavorful. it's spicy without being sweat inducing and I even added their hot sauce and chili oil for an extra kick. the ramen noodles themselves have the perfect amount of chew also. it's worth mentioning that our service both times was fantastic. 

the bathrooms are extremely clean which is always a plus. I love the open concept kitchen as well. the only complaints and reason for 4 stars is that they can't legally serve alcohol during sunday brunch (huge bummer), they should absolutely add some bao to the brunch menu and the disposable napkin dispensers on the table do not cut it when you're eating noodles. cloth napkins would be much more suitable. all in all, this is obviously the best and most authentic ramen in cleveland (which I know is not saying much) but it's really really delicious and filling a much needed ramen void here!",2,Qxlqs1O-T2Cb2bNGWMZ8bg,180388636339,202,1,1

We ordered a large house pho, fresh rolls, and the meat platter. We asked to hold onto the menu as we weren't sure how big the portion sizes were, but given a hesitant look as the waiter explained they didn't have enough menus and that if we wanted anything else we could get the menu back later.

Food came a little slower than other pho places we've been to. And the time it took between getting our appetizer and mains was a little longer than preferred.

Fresh rolls 4/5
Hard to go wrong with fresh rolls to be honest.. but expected a few more pieces or larger pieces with a $7 price tag.

House Pho 3.5/5
Nice clean broth. Mom really enjoyed the noodles, said they had a nice texture to them. Could have had a little more meat in it though. Ended up ordering another one of these because it's a little smaller than your average pho place.

Bbq meat plate 3.5/5
Pork belly skewers were fantastic! Would have been happy if the whole platter was just that. Flavor on the chicken was good, but a little dry. Same with the beef short ribs.

Overall the food was good but service needed some work. They have good intentions of being friendly, but I think they still have some work to do. After we ordered, a waiter came and asked if we liked spicy. Literally words were ""do you like spicy"" with no other context. Then, when our pho came, my family is used to family style, so we asked for 3 bowls to share. It took 5 minutes to get 3 bowls, so we just sat there staring at our noodles. Waters were also never refilled. Has potential though as time goes on.

Good place to come with friends if everyone is paying for their own meals, but as a family I would go to another pho place as prices are higher (even with the 10% discount) here and it doesn't seem like the dishes are really family-style friendly.",2,2L_dRXjl7mUQmck3tkRm1w,1236950592506,209,1,1

The meat and red wine sauce were great (especially since it was a chain bar/restaurant) and I'm a sucker for anything with sweet potato.  TM on the other hand had the opposite experience.  He couldn't even finish half of his meal as it started to make him gag.  Personally, I didn't blame him.  The sauce was more cream than cheese and the lobster was tasteless with an odd texture - somewhere between rubbery and moist.  There was a breadcrumb topping, but it lacked flavour as well.  The only thing edible about it was the side salad it came with.

Now, I can forgive a bad dish, especially when the other was good.  Sometimes things happen.  What I can't forgive is slow service, especially in a half empty restaurant.  We waiting close to 30 minutes for our food and another 20 minutes after eating for the bill.  Once we were all ready to pay, I had to hunt down our waiter to process the payment because he failed to come back to us.  I found him chatting with a friend of his.  Sorry to interrupt your conversation!

The real disappointment was finding out AFTER we paid that the gift card was also good at Fionn MacCool's and other restaurants.  Ah well - lesson learned to always read the fine print.",1,GPASJQMtRKQ5kxlXK29UjQ,17624,215,1,1

I won't dwell on the service, about which many have commented (which I could actually deal with if the food were good).  I'll start with the fact that none of the wine glasses set up at our table looked clean (all had some white-ish film and mine had a little extra something on it).  That's not acceptable at the prices they charge.  The real problem is the food.  We ordered chopped green salads that were something that looked like a 7-year old could make.  The toasted ravioli may daughters ordered looked and tasted like something you can try in the aisles of Costco on Saturday morning.  The quality of our steaks wasn't bad, but they weren't very juicy.  Of the 4 steaks we ordered, only one was cooked to the medium-rare that we asked for.  The others were medium to medium-well.  I ordered steak fries that were actually seasoned well, but were undercooked and looked like slightly higher quality than something you'd find in an elementary school lunch.  We ordered bananas foster (table-side service) for dessert.  it was kind of a fun process watching it flame up.  Taste-wise, it was just a sugar-bomb with only half a banana in it.  I'll sum up with 3 notes.

1.  I went here on the recommendation of my best friend, who is a certified foodie.  However, my wife reminded me after our beyond-disappointing-for-the-price meal that my friend is Hindu and generally doesn't eat beef (so maybe he doesn't know it when beef isn't great?).

2.  My wife said the best dish was the broccoli (which was a single steamed, unseasoned crown).  To be fair, my wife really liked her apple-tini.

3.  My daughters' comment after dinner:  ""The water was nice and cold.""

This one is much bigger, and even includes an outdoor patio area. Came around 2pm on a Saturday and waited around 10 mins, only because we did not want to sit outside. Seating is relatively spacious, although most of the tables are meant for smaller groups of 2/4. 

Ordered the curry beef brisket (w rice) myself, while others ordered the baked seafood alfredo rice and the lotus leaf wrapped rice. The prices throughout the lunch menu are quite decent, with most items ranging from $10-12. Service was attentive and relatively quick. As for the food, the curry was deceptively large, served in a separate bowl with plenty of brisket and a mix of onions, carrots, and potatoes. The flavor was strong but not overpowering, and made for a good mix with the rice. Didn't try the other items, but it seems everyone in my group was satisfied with both the portions and the taste. 

Extras: Cold drinks +1.50 from a lunch meal, takeout box +0.5 so bring your own! points for the free wifi as well.

This restaurant had lots of good reviews on yelp and I love tacos so I thought I would give it a try. I travel for a living and make it a point to find taco stands, taco trucks, or anything taco related wherever I go.  

I was disappointed here.

I read several reviews about the service been so-so to lousy, and that was my experience today.  The hostess was slow to recognize me when I walked up, took some menus and said she would be right back. She did not say hi or welcome me, just turned around and left.

I went to go sit at the bar and was also slow to be recognized as far as a greeting.  I also had to ask for chips and salsa just like several other yelpers have complained about, because I sat there for five minutes after ordering my tacos, and I still didn't have chips or salsa.  

I ordered the tacos al pastor and ahi tuna combo with rice and beans.  There was plenty of tuna on the one taco, but the taco Al Pastor was the smallest most pathetic taco I think I have ever seen.  I think it had more pineapple than pork.   In fact I'm not even sure there was any meat in it.  Way less tasty than they should have been.  

As for the chips and salsa, the chips were stout, not the flimsy kind and were good enough.  The salsa was thin and runny but the green and red both had good flavor.  Sad to say, then chips and salsa were the best part.",2,R0jFfodw91dDWfe1cRAkZA,326417520226,246,1,1

Dropped by on a Sunday afternoon around 12:30 pm. No need to wait for a table but the restaurant is 80% full.

They have all the usual selections but with a little twist. We ordered chicken feet in abalone sauce, shark fin and shrimp dumplings, siu mai, a congee and a few others. Yes they all tasted much better than the cheaper dim sum places.

Don't remind me. The pastas were gummy, the meats were gristly, and what minor amounts of seafoods were out were overcooked and tasted off. We started in line at 11, thinking that was plenty of time for brunch, but got in close to 2, which meant nothing was fresh and the dinner foods hadn't been put out.

Exposed ceilings, cheap local art for purchase on the walls, a view of the really cool pool area, then walked into the ""gallo blanco"". I was 1 of 2 people there. I sat at the bar
I sat down and scanned the menu that was on the chalkborarded walls. The server handed me a wine list. I had vino blanco from Argentina.

       We started off with the Ahi Tuna Tartare and Crab stuffed mushrooms and both were of amazing quality, the flavors were out of this word.  The house salad was next and it did not disappoint with the buttermilk bleu cheese dressing, onions, tomatoes, and plenty of Shrimp it could has easily been a meal itself.  
       Now to the main course i had the bone-in ribeye  which was perfectly rare all the way through and charred on the outside and my wife had the bone in fillet medium rare and both were to die for, hands down some of the best beef i have ever experienced.  
       Oh wait i forgot the sides an order of the lobster mashed potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese and the Colossal onion rings all of which exceeded already high expectations.  The mashed potatoes were velvety with loads of flavor and a large amount of lobster incorporated, the Mac was as it should be nice and cheesy without being overdone, and the onion rings were perfect easy to eat because you could actually bite through the onion and it did not slide out after the first bite.  
       The wine selection is one of the best in the Valley with a wide variety of wines uner $100 and plenty of excellent wines above the $100 price point.  We ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and they discovered that they were out of it and offered one at a higher price for the price of the one i had ordered, they didn't have to but it was nice.         
      Mastro's is a complete experience and it is the little things that they do that make going there better than say Ruth's Chris or another steakhouse in Scottsdale or PV.  
We will be going back much more often and this is now my go to steakhouse in the valley and all others will be measured against it and most likely come up short where Mastro's exceeds.

Our waitress (Christen?) started things off right with her friendly and warm style.  When my date wanted to know which sides were best, Christen brought out huge samples of the sides we were interested in.  Our glasses were never empty and our table was consistently bussed.  We chose the smoked wings for an appetizer and since we come from the ""wingland"" (near Buffalo, NY) we were not disappointed.  Big, meaty wings that were slathered in sauce and cooked perfectly.  We opted for small Caesar salads and were surprised.  The romaine was cold and crisp and the dressing was as good as any at many a high-end restaurant we've been to. Cornbread.  Damn, that cornbread was GREAT.  Then entrees:  I had the 3 meats: sausage, brisket and chicken.  Each was perfect.  Smoky, tangy and tender.  The brisket may just be the best I've had.  My date had the prime brisket and raved about it.  I was only offered the tiniest of samples from her but was amazed - that WAS the best brisket... ever.  At the end of the meal we remarked how terrific everything was (especially the cornbread) and asked for a box to take our remaining pieces to-go.  We were surprised when Christen brought out a box with an additional 6 pieces.  I had ordered the Sub Zero banana cream square to-go.  I was asked if it was ok for it to come out a little later, as the manager invited us back to the kitchen to look around and specifically to see the industrial-sized smokers.  That was an incredibly gracious gesture.  I even got some meat smokin' secrets out of him!  Again - a warm, friendly, gracious guy with a genuine smile and offered a feeling of being ""family"".  By the time we got back to the table my huge desert to-go was ready and we were fat and happy.

I think it's a fun and different experience.

Then I realized they would just look at me like I was nuts. 

My friend and I both got the galley boy then split an order of mushrooms, potato teasers, and a Florida and California. Ehhh. I've decided the galley boy and the drinks were a little sweet for me. I'd probably do better with just a normal burger. The potato teasers are a mix up of jalapeño poppers and a tater tot so that basically sold me. 

I think most people love this place for nostalgic purposes. It was good, but nothing to write home about.

But what comes to mind when thinking about what it is that differentiates this buffet mainly from the rest is portion control...

Nearly all of the items of the AYCE buffet are individually served in small cups, dishes, bowls, and even miniature saucier pans.  The effort is worth it since it results in a tidier, neater appearance throughout the serving area,  one can say that it's even a bit minimalist chic.  Items such as the Braised Short Rib http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Pt101ZxBy4xxJZ9vyLFWeQ and the Creamed Corn http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=I_4S14ETI6Ahy4lOpz7WKQ are somehow more appealing than usual, and there is also the added benefit that flavors don't run together on your plate.  There is also a bit more civility and efficiency when reaching for an item as well...

What would an AYCE be without the obligatory carving station.  At WS the prime rib is delectable,http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=U3-hRhqxkXSE0z-UN9dY2Q perfectly medium rare pink in the middle, and sliced to order,  I usually have my eye on the outside or end cut for greater seasoning taste.  On this occasion, they were also offering Roast Leg of Lamb http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=5fP1-uJVh49d-LELABqR0A,  however I found it to be particularly dry, especially since I got one of the first slices that are typically sliced parallel and away from the bone.  The perpendicular slices closer to the bone are more moist, even gamier, perhaps too much for some, but I like it.  Also in the category of not everyone's cup of tea is the beefy Bone Marrow http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=Db6R_AfMgkEU1SFlvsX1cQ located in front of the carving station.  The way to eat it is to spread the marrow like jam onto the nearby slices of bruschetta toast,  without which it would pretty much just taste like solid fat...

From among all the seafood choices, I went for:

- Mussels with fennel, onions, and pancetta;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=tN4AWvccv0dynEl7oS5hOA
- Blackened Haddock with crawfish hollendaise;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=XATYdWxx7PaALBbF8PL3gQ
- Shrimp cocktail;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=A0B0-WaLPZ92kIIN1SNHKg
- Ceviche;http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=K416rA7f9g9RypgA3fsLIQ

I could have eaten a ton of the Mussels and the giant sized Shrimp and I did.  The Haddock was nicely breaded and fork flaky, but a little bit too heavy and chunky, I would expect this like most fish to be best when served straight out of the oven or from the pan, but instead it was probably sitting for awhile.  The ceviche was ok but lacked any pop or wow factor, and like the haddock is best when super fresh...

Of all the salads to choose from, my strategy was to be severely limiting because I would rather not get filled up on salad at a place like this.  So my personal choice of the evening was the Thai Mango Salad http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=g9LLM5vZ1z84RaZmR_cftA, which was had all the requisite flavors and textures that I was looking for --  the cold noodle was vinegary but tangy and paired with the mango beautifully.  Edamame was added for opposing texture and crunch.  Also offered near the salad bar was a very interesting cold Watermelon Gazpacho soup served in a plastic cup http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/K7lWdNUhCbcnEvI0NhGewg?select=UyPfzd6XRp1uGl_mcyBbpA -- fruity, a bit thick, but refreshing...

The seating near the dessert end of the dining room is nicer in my opinion than the other end which is near the restrooms.  Even so, I ate so much that I didn't make too much of effort with the desserts, although I gave it a half-hearted try...

We visited early in a several-day decompression stopover after Burning Man 2011, and loved it so much that we had to come again on our way out of town.

When entering, you are faced with a cozy little mom and pop type of diner environment.  Janee, the serving staff, will greet you and right away tell you what is available today.  She is friendly, warm, and engaging.

There is no menu besides the two boards (specials and favorites), and the dessert case.  We had on our first visit a jace wrap, a quesadilla, and a pasta dish, all were excellent - deserving special notice is the bean salsa.  The limeade was great, too, and the ""Kangen Water"" (water with a lot of Eco-friendliness and balanced stuff).  And the desserts - brownies and a warm chocolate cake with chocolate syrup - were fantastic.  

Pro-tip: if you drink 3/4ths of a limeade and have Janee top it off with their apple water, the mix is fantastic!

On our second visit, we got waffles and ""two loves"" burritos.  The burritos were great - the waffles were great for vegan waffles, but I would not recommend them to omnivores (waffles are tough to do vegan, they really need that whipped egg white froth to form a light and airy structure).

Chef Mayra is enthusiastic about her food, and is passionate about making sure diners enjoy it.  Our first visit, we
were the only ones here (we came just before close - we did not realize it, and they did not pressure us at all, but we ended up leaving an hour after close), and she spent some time visiting with us. More impressive was our second time - even in the middle of the lunch hour rush, she made sure to visit with every patron.  She is really engaged with her business, and it is clearly her calling!

You do not have to be vegan to enjoy the food here - I am not (though my partner is).  If you have the time to go just a few miles from the strip, you owe it to yourself to try the food here!",2,FYjQm_BQRlQZRFto43FXsw,558345755696,320,0,0

I had the baked fish fillet with cream corn. You have the option of having it with spaghetti or rice, and I opted for spaghetti (which is my preference for any baked dish at an HK-style cafe). My friend had a meatier version with pork, beef and mushroom sauce. The service was quick and to the point, but beware if you can't speak Cantonese as the servers aren't too fluent in English. The menu is in English, however, so you can make do with pointing at the dish you want from the menu and saying key words like 'bill', but don't expect much more than that. The food was great half way through and the portions were good. However, the food isn't exactly on the light side, so I felt a little overwhelmed with the heavy sauce and fatty slices of fish after that. Please ensure you have a lot of room or have a high tolerance for fattening foods! Also, the dishes come with a cream soup and a drink for an extra dollar. For most, it's a great deal, but the cream soup has chicken bits, so beware vegetarians.  Most clients ordered iced tea as their drink, which surprised me because  HK milk tea has always been the holy grail of HK-style cafes in my opinion. My friend ordered the said milk tea and I ordered coffee for that morning caffeine rush. His milk tea came almost instantly, but my coffee arrived only after I reminded the servers three times - yeah, my two cents is to stick with the milk tea or iced tea if you need a beverage immediately... Overall, this is your typical HK-style cafe with minimal service and heavy, high-calorie dishes. If you're looking for some cheap eats that isn't McDonald's, then it's worth a shot. I wouldn't see myself going out of my way to come here though because it's the same as other HK-style cafes in my backyard of Scarborough.",0,uz5-sq6wHrXScrIWb8r1Mg,283467848242,321,1,1

Sometimes, when I'm in college, I'll dream about getting a good cup of cold boba and desperately long for KFT.

I wouldn't really recommend this as a place to sit-down or chat because it's really loud, but I love coming here after getting KBBQ at Hwaro or ramen from Monta. 

My favorite thing to get here is my super special top secret recipe drink: White Gourd Milk Half Green/Half Oolong Tea with Half Boba/Half Egg Pudding and light ice. Their boba is made fresh every two hours, and I absolutely love how they soak it in a light honey mixture so it doesn't have that bland/rubbery texture. 

My second favorite drink to get is a Mango Snow - it's like a mango smoothie but creamier. It's hard to describe, but almost everyone I've recommended it to has praised me. :-) Okay not really but a lot of people I've recommended it to have been very happy.

I tried the Cubano sandwich, with a side of fries, pineapple and mango dole whip soft serve, and white chocolate covered cinnamon sugar mini doughnuts.

If you're a fan of Five Guys you'll know what these fries will taste like - freshly cut salted in a bowl and placed in a paper cut. Top it with gravy, cheese curds and bacon and you're in for a stellar Poutine.

The soft serve was fantastic - the place opened in September and I can imagine the dole whip machines are new - but the soft serve was a very creamy and cool consistency. I took one to go and the soft serve held it's shape for entire trip home. When I got to Disney World, the must have is the pineapple dole whip - this place is right in my backyard serving the exact same consistency! Next time I'll bring some pineapple juice to place the soft serve in and I'll be on my own mini vacation!

As for the mini doughnuts - they have more than 10 toppings from chocolate sauce to cinnamon sugar/ powdered sugar. Any mix and they'll happily give you samples. They have the dough and mini fryer that the little kids love to watch - nothing beats fresh!

In general I hesitate to find places that serve way too many products - but this place puts focus and attention to everything that is come here for breakfast lunch and desert in one stop.

Inside was much nicer than the mirrored glass would suggest. I got the half and half chicken for two people, at the server's suggestion. The spicy was more sweet than spicy, which isn't really my thing, but that's a personal preference and I know I'm an outlier. There was a ton of chicken.

If you're in the neighborhood, this is a pretty solid option. I'm not much for fried chicken, but every once in a while I get a craving, so I'll probably be back to check out this patio they supposedly have.",0,iquCZU8tjmRQrnDgci5YpQ,910533074038,345,0,0

More than that, it was simply not good. I'm not sure if the food was just old and done for the day, as we were there about an hour before closing time, or what, but the meat was basically sprayed with some sauce and they called it a day. The meat was devoid of flavor and overcooked. I had chicken but the ribs were absolutely nothing to sneeze at either. The corn on the cob was simply some frozen piece nuked up or boiled or what-have-you, with some chips thrown in for good measure and that was about it.

The insides aren't impressive in the slightest, either. I've been to plenty of dive places and had a great dining experience and considered it more the fun for it (Lolo's original location in Phoenix comes to mind, as it has a certain fun and well-managed charm inside) but this was dark, dingy, and unpleasant.

The sauce was perhaps a saving grace if the food wasn't served nearly lukewarm and was able to bring something to the table on its own. Sadly, no amount of sauce-drowning could save my meal. I left unhappy and unfulfilled.

We booked a Valentine's Day reservation here and checked in only to be seated at a made up row of tables behind the host stand. The table was awkward and didn't feel like a nice romantic date at all but a place for people who check in to see what you ordered so we asked to be moved inside the dining room. For the price that we knew we would be spending, this table was a joke. 

Once we were seated at a different table, menus were brought over and we had a chance to look things over. After looking at the menu online, the first thing I noticed when I was given the menu was that prices had been raised a few dollars on every single item due to it being Valentine's day. I know that's how it works with fine dining and holidays, and we knew we would be paying for a nice night out and of course a fancy meal being the holiday, but we walked away paying $300 for a meal for two with a few drinks and two steaks seemed really excessive to me for the M resort. 

I ordered the surf and turf which included a filet mignon and a small piece of lobster which was $82. My husband ordered the tomahawk steak which was around $70 I believe. We also ordered a Caesar salad for $18 and scalloped potatoes for $11. 

The Caesar salad was good, huge pieces of Parmesan frico, salty anchovies and a perfect ratio of lettuce and dressing. My husbands steak was delicious as well. We could see the open kitchen from our table and the open grill method made for a flavorful steak when they topped it with butter and salt. My filet was also good and cooked a perfect medium. Neither steak needed any additional seasoning. The potatoes were probably my favorite. Thin slices of soft potato layered in between creamy cheese, butter and herbs. It was a nice helping and a great side for our steaks. The lobster tasted a little tough to me and I believe it had been over cooked. 

Our server was very busy, we could tell. We had to ask for a bread basket, drink refills seemed a little delayed and plates weren't cleared in a timely manner, but he was still good. 

I love the M and thought this was a good meal, but it wasn't an amazing meal. I just can't wrap my head around paying such a large price again for this steakhouse.",6,_8y-kAoK4BQ_MmzawRpQFw,1116691508851,377,1,1

if you do venture to firefly despite the snobby service i would make sure to try the tuna tartare. it is very sweet and something i always would get. the stuffed dates which are full of flavor. terra y mare skewers were great and i got to taste three different meats. the filet mignon sliders with firefly fries are pretty good and basic if you are afraid to let your taste buds explore. i also really like the empanadas. it had a little spice to it which won me. i also like their infused vodka. you can really taste the berries and lychees, but beware because they hit you fast.

They apologized and said they had removed it from the bill (no really?). Disappointing... so we went elsewhere for dessert after. Other dim sum places are much quicker.

Came here around 7 on a Wednesday. It was a little busy from three rather large crowds (4-5 people each) so service was a bit slow and food took about 20 minutes to get. I don't blame the workers though, there was only 1 worker at first, and then someone came a bit later to help out. 

Ordered the beef brisket sandwich, pulled pork sandwich, half rack of ribs and a side of coleslaw. Total was around $43 including taxes. The sandwiches are quite small - smaller than I expected when they're $9-12. A grown adult could easily eat 1.5 sandwiches. I also wasn't a big fan of them only offering the meat in sandwich form. I prefer beef brisket on its own. 

In terms of taste the food was alright, but I've had much better before. The pulled pork seemed pretty dry, maybe because there wasn't enough sauced. The beef brisket was actually probably the best. Coleslaw wasn't good and I could easily make a better one myself. Ribs were ok.

We started with the unlimited chips and salsa, and asked for both the mild and medium salsa, which was not a problem  We also ordered the chips and queso, which is a white queso, with pico and jalapenos (on the side please).  Hubby ordered a regular margarita with salt and I opted for a frozen without salt.  They're served in these little mason jar things and were surprisingly yummy (and you could taste the booze).

We had originally planned on ordering an entree to split; however, by the time we put a dent in the chips, salsa and queso, we were full!  Next time, nachos or bust!

When we told our waitress Perla M. that we were too full to order an entree, she explained the free margaritas with yelp check-in required an entree purchase.  Completely understandable (and still a very generous offer) and we said 'hey, no worries, we understand' and she said she'd try to 'help us out'.  She returned a few minutes later and said she was able to get our drinks comped for us!  That was completely unnecessary but very much appreciated!

Ventilation.  We were first seated at a table that felt like it was in a wind tunnel.

We asked to be reseated and fortunately the place was mostly empty so we were.  The new table was an improvement -- until the kitchen revved up.  Then the place became far smokier (and oilier) than any restaurant ought to be.

Food.  Mediocre at best.  The maitre d' (who doubled as a waiter) warned us that the food was very spicy-- 1 to 10 ""and that's Thai 1 to 10, not American.""  So I ordered a 1.  Completely tasteless.  

Service.  The maitre d' was a clown and a compulsive talker.  If the atmosphere and the food hadn't already spoiled the dinner, he most certainly would have.

Considering how many Thai restaurants there are (some of which are within a stone's throw of this place) and some of which are pretty good or even excellent, this place is so low on the list that it's not worth patronizing.

The service was good and the restaurant itself has a great vibe and a feel trendy feel to it. I love the open concept and all the outdoor seating they have available. 
I wasn't super impressed with the food. The meal started out great when we started with the watermelon mango salad. Probably one of the best salads I've ever had. Very fresh and light with a whole bunch of flavor. There's some sort of spice that they put on it that adds a great unexpected kick. 
I ordered the ocotillo chicken, my mom ordered the pork flautas, and a friend ordered the pork shoulder sand which. All of the meals came and the presentation was great. However the food looks a lot better than it tastes. I actually had to ask for something else because my chicken was sickly sweet, and I'm a sweets person. I was not a fan of the taste whatsoever. They replaced it happily with the pasta dish with the pork meatballs. That dish was much better, the meatballs were very flavorful and paired well with the pasta. I tried both of my companions meals and wasn't too impressed with their meals either.

The Lamb Stew (Georgian style) was very tasty but I would suggest for them to render the fat first off the lamb before they put it in the crock pot.  There was a bit of fat on each piece and some a bit too much fat.  Overall though it was a good dish.

Half an hour later, the buffet was half full at this point we should have walked, but hubby knew I had been wanting to try so we decided to stay.

Maybe our familiarity with the flawlessness that is Friday night at the bar at Santisis is where the problem lies. Went there today for Father's Day and the seemingly warm waitress pointed out, ""You got here at the same time everyone else did!"" I candidly replied, ""we BROUGHT them all here ;)"" with a playful attitude. At first it seemed harmless enough, our initial beer orders were handled with grace but the food was a bit delayed given the crowd- as I said we are used to the Friday night bustle with one bartender, Debbie, who doesn't even sweat with the craziness. We got our food, the server seemed put out and when my fiancé politely asked for another sauce as the bartender's leisurely replied, ""you're going to have to give me a minute, you only ordered two."" And I get it-it may sound petty but it was a kind request returned with hostility. I understand you're busy. Santisi is busy because the food and drinks are amazing! And in general the service is too. So I let that one slide. About the time we were about done eating about ten minutes later, the bartender brought the sauce my fiancé requested- without eye contact or verbal response. Twenty minutes later I decided to place my payment up for grabs. No one had been by to ask how the food was, If we would like more drinks or if we needed anything else. Sitting at the bar usually means attentive service, however today this was not the case. I was frustrated at being ignored so I put up a ""went outside for a smoke"" paper on my bar spot. We had a few chicken strips left which I wanted to bring home but, again no one had offered to help. I sat outside and finished my beer in peace and upon my arrival to the bar the bartender informed me I wasn't  ""allowed"" to go outside without leaving a payment/card. I thought this was ironic and explained to her that I had been trying to pay for a bit and was ignored so I went outside where it was quieter to drink my beer. Let me yet say that I was standing up for the waitresses' attitude until this point. I was a server for over seven years in my past life, I understand what it's like to be busy. Nonetheless I was frustrated, as was my fiancé, as we were not accustomed at all to this treatment. At the end of the transaction the bartender remarked that I had lost my partner, I felt no qualms about informing Nancy that he had left because he wouldn't tolerate her rudeness. She seemed put off and apologized for being busy. I explained that I was accustomed to visiting Santisi on Friday nights, when it was WAY busier than today and that Debbie never seemed to have an issue. I commented that maybe she wasn't suited for such a busy atmosphere- she replied ""thank you"".",0,lnOXp_XBZRzStp-Nskzz2Q,1400159340172,438,0,0

One thing I love is they don't get lazy with the simple rolls. Even their California Rolls are deelish. (I only know this from eating off of my friends' plates).

I am sure the menu describes it better, but just eat it and be amazed. I recently tried the Lobster Spring Rolls. The roll is crispy and flaky and the lobster is always perfectly prepared. It comes atop what I think is a mango puree AKA mango baby food, but the mix of the lobster, cream cheese and super sweet puree makes for a party on the tongue.

My boyfriend and I came on a friday night around 12am and it was packed. I heard and read good things about this place so why not? Their happy hour menu is pretty good with half-off on their select nigiri and simple rolls. They had a large house sake for $4.50 during happy hour.

Decor: Small, packed, loud. Clean. Kind of regret not grabbing a seat at the sushi bar! Faster service that way.

We ordered a few rolls (Johnny, That's What She Say) to start. It took 30-40 minutes to get 3 rolls types. By the end of the night we had 6 rolls, house sake, and two orders of gyoza in an hour and 40 minutes.

The fish was flavorful, fresh, rich, and delicious. Pretty generous on the fish as well. Presentation was beautiful. The sauces were drizzled with care on our rolls. The sushi itself tantalized our taste buds. 

It's a bit pricey since it's all ala carte and we know it's not all-you-can-eat. For a non-AYCE joint, we expected maybe faster service despite the quality rolls. They came out at a snail's pace that we kept getting hungry in between finishing each roll dish. We felt a bit sorry for the lone waitress doing everything from cleaning, tending to other customers, getting side dish orders etc. She was doing her best to serve everyone though. Maybe the service wouldn't have suffered as much if they had another waitress/waiter or maybe an extra chef. Don't get me wrong, we didn't expect them to come out with our order immediately, but it took FOREVER to get each one!  

For the price we paid (Around $80ish by the end of the night just between the two of us), I kind of wished we chose another place. It was a delicious meal, just not-so-great timing on the sushi. I don't mind paying for sushi, but if I'm paying quite a bit extra for an ala carte place, I expected a bit better in terms of timeliness.

First impression walking thru the door was good. Small waiting area. The decor was nice and unique. 

We got seated right away which was extra plus because we were starving.

So, I got my bowl. It looked good. When I finished garnishing my pho and took the first bite.... Hmmm... Let me see.... I felt the broth was flavorful but the meat ball was nasty. The broth was unique in itself. But I wanted to like it but ended up being disappointed. 

I gave them 3 stars because of customer services. They were very attentive to filling up my ice water and asking how we are doing.

I recall the first time I had ever seen ordering food on iPads. It wasn't at Pearson International Airport. It was actually at Charlotte International Airport. Several months later, Pearson had caught on.

Apropos is in Terminal 1. I plopped myself down at a seat and ordered through the iPad. I got fish tacos and hummus with pita. I also ordered a Diet Coke to wash everything down.

The fish tacos have soft shells. You get three of them. They were delicious. The spicy avocado worked well with the lime cream and pico de gallo.

I also loved the hummus. The grilled pita wedges were both tender and crispy. Perfect!

Naturally, when dining at the airport, you pay a lot more. I remember the price, which was pushing $30 for two small plates of food and a beverage, including tax and tip. I didn't mind it, though. The quality and taste were good. I also don't dine at the airport too often and I was hungry.

My beef was trying to pay for my meal. You are supposed to be able to do it on the iPad. It didn't work on mine. Instead, I had to flag my server to try and sort it out. You'd think that he would have a debit-credit machine. Nope, I had to move to a different iPad that he had selected that wasn't close. Yes, I had to haul all my belongings (rolling computer bag, my sweater, and me) several feet away. It was an inconvenience to me. 

I can also see this problem being a huge one if you are a larger party. How can you make sure that your personal belongings are safe when you are practically going to a different gate to pay for your meal?

I am hoping that this issue has been fixed. I have a feeling that it's still the case, though.

You have the choice of getting 8 pcs instead of 12 with the dame old price or paying 6$ more for the usual 12 pcs combo.

The wine was above average. The passed apps, which were clearly advertised as part of the tasting, didn't really materialize in the hour I was there. I received one appetizer, and it appeared they were more interested in giving menus than sharing their chef's appetizers. 
Whine, right?
The event is held Thursdays at 9 in the back of the restaurant in a casual seating area. I was waiting for someone from Hearthstone or Light Group to come around to the group, but didn't notice anyone. So I didn't get to plead my case about the lack (almost) of apps. Next time, for sure. 
The music is too loud (it's s a restaurant, not a nightclub). The decor is nice, kind of rustic/chic. 
Maybe I'm too old (obviously) but it didn't entice me to come here to dine. Outside on the patio would be fine, without the music.",4,Kp5KHBSmV-Htc9NeSjJfPA,979252552062,485,0,0

Big disappointment. It did not taste like Japanese curry I've had elsewhere. It was just yellow gravy with a tad of spiciness.  The slices of beef did not help either. It didn't look like the picture on the menu.

The ramen noodles do not look like authentic ramen, more like Chinese noodles.

We also had the okonomiyaki.  There was no description, but it taste like takoyaki in pancake form, a little bit of octopus.

They also offered bubble tea.  I don't think that's Japanese.  As some other yelpers have mentioned, this is probably a Chinese-own establishment.

From the samosa (get the lamb, trust me!) to the delicious warm naan, everything my husband and I tried was delicious.  Even my glass of Riesling was refreshing and a generous pour.  Atmosphere-wise, a few too many families trying to convince their distracted toddlers to try tandoori chicken for the first time.  My advice, just don't.  Service was good, our waiter was super-friendly and quick.  

Portions were a little small for the price.  My $14 chicken korma was awesome but the silver bowl is came in was kinda small.  I'm sorry but I enjoy Indian food leftovers!  My husband had to tandoori mixed grill and it was super tasty.  A bit heavy on the peppers and onions - more meat & fish would have been appreciated.  If you can handle spice, go for the medium.  It's plenty.

I got the beef tallarines saltado (noodles) with a fried egg on top and 1/4 chicken on the side along with the complimentary soup, dessert and soda with check-in. My friend accompanied me and she is Peruvian and mentioned now nothing tastes as good as homemade but she gave it a shot. She got the Inko gold soda which brought back good memories as sipped it on ice. My friend had also ordered the purple corn drink and fried rice aka chaufas. I would say it was worth the price for what we got. I really enjoyed the soap; it's one of those things that every culture has to get you by when you're feeling a little under the weather. My friend thought the fried rice was pretty good in taste and quality. I would say that's a good thing coming from a Peruvian. Though, she also got charged twice and there was a bit of a mix up. 

May or may not come back. For the price, I would probably eat here for a nice hearty meal if I'm in the area though I don't feel like Pollo Inka showcases the best of Peruvian food. It's a good start.",3,UCjsKncHPTmLOH9sCkjQtw,300647719176,492,1,1

A tiny shop that's got a simple Japanese tapas bar setup with a diverse menu and a full house! I was shocked by the number of people here in the middle of the week for dinner - it wasn't even warm weather that day.

My friend and I were eager to catch up over a few shared items, so we grabbed the agedashi tofu, grilled eggplant, okonomiyaki, karaage, and an udon bowl. It didn't seem like much but it was plenty for our small appetites. She doesn't eat raw fish, so sashimi and tataki items were out of the question. Normally, this is totally not a problem at a location with this kind of menu, but it seemed like that was what everyone was talking about here at Koyoi, or there's been a lot of changes to the kitchen since those amazing reviews.

Overall, the food was nothing to write home about. Everything was just ok, if not worse. I struggled to give three stars but wanted to give the benefit of the doubt that we just didn't get their signature items. The agedashi tofu had a stubborn sticky coat that refused to separate with my bites, which ruined the experience. The eggplant was accompanied by bonito flakes - the flavour combination was poor and my eggplant was way overcooked. Everything else was passable, meaning I could go elsewhere for better.

There was also a lack of ventilation and sitting near the back beside the washrooms and kitchen meant odd odours wafted at us all dinner. Not the greatest, but something attributable to our poor luck.

The reason my partner & I came here to eat is because we are both vegetarians and they have the most veggie ramen options out of all the other places whose menu I looked at. My partner ordered the vegetarian miso ramen soup with vegan noodles & I ordered the spicy vegetarian miso ramen soup w/ thick noodles. Both of the soups were amazing.

Although the food is great at either place----the experience is better at Ha Long!
