I've been here twice: Once with my boyfriend (He got hamburger steak and I got katsu saimin) and another time to eat chicken katsu curry.  Both times we got our food quicker than you can say ""try pass the shoyu, brah"".  I loved the saimin and it reminded me of home, for serious.  My boyfriend loved the hamburger steak because it came with lots of gravy.  The second time I came and got the katsu curry it came with THREE pieces of katsu, usually I get only one (Aloha Kitchen!).  The down side was that the curry sauce was like L&L curry sauce and I think that kine is gross.  Katsu curry should be full on curry all over everything not that Hawaiian curry in a small little sauce container, but I can't complain about the portion and I still ate it all.

Kampachi ceviche, nice portion and awesome flavors, crispy squid  on top and a bed of smashed avocado. So good

Our sever recommended the mozzarella stuffed yuca with a spicy cilantro sauce. Good choice by the server cause it was one of the favorites, my girlfriend said she could eat a whole plate of them.

Grilled Hokkaido scallops were fire. Same with the crispy duck both I think were my favorites.

The albacore sashimi had amazing complex flavors and the sauce it was in you could drink.

Avocado toast with spicy tuna on top. I don't think I need to say more. I just wish I wasn't so full.

Oh and before I forget. The pork ribs. These were the best pork ribs I've ever had and I've worked in BBQ all my life.

She didnt apologize, but said she would take it back to the kitchen. I believe a supervisor or manager came out to apologize after, which I appreciated. She said the dish would be re-done, and it came back out a little while later. I was honestly pretty shocked though that when they bill came, they offered no discount or comp for the salad as a good gesture. I work in the restaurant business and even when a dish is slightly late/delayed, we've given discounts/comps out. That's just how you attract customers to come back and to spread the good word about your customer service.

I don't know the names of the food, and I don't know what it tastes like in whatever country.

It was really good. I don't know what I eat at these places, but I know what I like and I like the food here.

It's plain naan, not garlic or any other flavoring. It doesn't HAVE to be, it gets its taste from the foods you eat with it.

There were two bartenders, the taller one seemed annoyed with us even though everyone was sitting at the bar with the exception of two of us and we just wanted food.  It was my step daughters 21st bday, we had been out, nobody in the party was drunk or obnoxious, we were just hungry and  wanted to eat.

I asked for a water with lemon and never got it.  I don't know what his issue was but I am just about done with paying for crappy service.

The rellano tasted like it had been frozen. We asked the server and he said fresh, but mu taste buds disagreed. The taco was just OK. Beef was seasoned and reminded me of a generic Taco Bell hard shell taco.The enchilada was good.

The reason why I even mention this is because every time my step dad and I come here to eat dinner, which is about once a month, it's always packed.  Is it possibly because we come here on a Friday night or a Saturday night?  Who knows.  But, there's always a wait and we don't like waiting.  Thus, we head for the bar area.

The bartenders are very quick to help us and give us our menus and serve us beverages.  Plus the great thing about sitting at the bar is seeing the cooks work their magic.  I am a fan of watching Food Network channel and so to see people cook is more entertaining for me than anything else.

Food is prepared really well.  My order as follows:

1.)  White Corn Guacamole & Chips 
Fresh avocado, sweet white corn, black beans, jicama, green onions, red bell pepper, cilantro and serrano peppers served with blue & white corn tortilla chips.
This is really good.  It's very fresh, light, and great for sharing also.

2.)  Mediterranean Plate 
Our original recipe of Tuscan white bean hummus, Feta cheese topped with extra virgin olive oil and a Greek salad with cucumbers, red onions, fresh Roma tomatoes and Greek olives in our homemade lemon-herb vinaigrette. Served with our traditional pizza-pita bread.
This is also light and great for a starter course.  I actually thought this was going to be like a Greek salad but was completely wrong.  Still liked it and will order it again.

3.)  Sedona Tortilla Soup
Vine-ripened tomatoes, tomatillos and corn with mild green chiles and Southwestern spices. Garnished with crispy corn tortilla strips.
This one is to die for.  I love this soup and will come back here just to order it again.

4.)  The Greek Pizza
Mediterranean spiced grilled chicken and Mozzarella cheese topped with a chilled Greek salad of cucumbers, red onions, fresh tomatoes, Greek olives, Feta cheese and a lemon-herb vinaigrette. Served with our homemade Tzatziki sauce and chopped Italian parsley. Vegetarian Option - Substitute avocado for grilled chicken.
This is my favorite of all pizzas I've ever eaten.  I think just the fact it's not heavy and the combination of flavors definitely engaged well together made it easy to fall in love with.

My step dad loves pizza so he ordered Vegetarian with Japanese Eggplant
Mozzarella cheese, baby broccoli, grilled Japanese eggplant, roasted corn, sliced red onions, mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes and our tomato sauce. Also available with mild goat cheese. Recommended on honey-wheat dough.
Since I was too full, I didn't get to taste it.  My stepdad says it's really good and ended up eating everything on the plate.  

This is the only CPK we go to.  I can't compare to any other and probably wouldn't need to.",0,QeZmjeEefdJ3bdbAeIHfWA,309237692584,37

VIBE 
Ouzeri is in the heart of Greektown on The Danforth. It's one of the nicer places to get your Greek fix or go on a date in the nabe. I love the big, black tiles on the floor and the rusticity of the orange paint on the walls. The walls and decor could use a little bit of a makeover. The tables could also be bigger because a basket of bread takes up half the table.  

I was here to treat my mother for Mother's Day. It was the perfect place for a great late lunch. Lots of other families are here too and the Greek music videos on the TV in corner are entertaining to say the least. It's casual and we never felt rushed. 

WE ATE 
Currently, they have a $25 prixe fixe menu which give you good value over the regular menu (I added it up...though it's interesting that they don't have the dessert listed on the main menu). I also like that they are many options to persuade you into buying prixe-fixe. 

Mom and I split a few of our dishes. We had the spanokopita, which are two generous portions and good. I recommend! The phylo is flaky and delish. 
We also had the trio of dips with warm pita bread. Skip the bread basket, as tempting as it is staring you right in the face. They do a pretty good taramousalata here (and I think you can get it during taste of the Danforth as well). 

I had the signature Rosemary lamb pie. It's hearty, meaty and filling. The flavour of the shank really does come out. It's served with a massive ""salad"" which is basically spring mix salad from the bag with some feta (at least they use real feta and not Canadian like at Mr. Greek's), red onion and a slathering of balsamic vinegar. I was craving roasted potatoes but with the prixe fixe won't pay extra for it. I wish I had the option. They should give you the option! 

Mom had the salmon which came with more sides like horta (wilted greens with lemon and olive oil) and rice. The salmon was tender, cooked well and topped with feta and tomatoes. It was a great dish and one I would recommend if you're looking for something healthy with a greek twist!

We were pretty stuffed at this point! 

Desserts were disappointing. The loukamades were drenched with honey and way too sweet for my tasting. They just looked like cheap, desperate pieces of dough screaming out to be eaten from the plate. And for $3 you get more than 4 pieces at Athens Bakery across the street. 

Mom had the creme caramel. It was soft and sweet as well. Not bad but not mind blowing. 

OBLIGATORY CATCHY REMARK 
Not sure if a prixe fixe was worth $70 for two (with tax, tip and drinks) but I still consider it good value for how stuffed we were after the meal. I'm not ""ouzing"" to go back but it's been a mainstay of the Danforth for a reason (or they just have really good rent control). Also, this is the first Greek restaurant I've been to where the waiters didn't serve us water at all. Shocking considering it's a water refill fest at the other establishments in the hood.",1,WHmabbfgdSW-JrOU9ePMrA,51539639136,38

We got married in 2004 when I was 3 months pregnant with my first child. We arrived at the hotel almost midnight (we drove from LA to Vegas, stopping at Yosemite and other places) and the staff, seeing how tired I was from the long journey (my husband also told them that I was 3 months along), pulled a chair out for me to sit down while my husband checked in. We told them that we were getting married a chapel the next morning and they congratulated us and upgraded our room to a penthouse for 2 nights. It was a great ""complimentary"" service on their part. I told myself, 'Great job Venetian. You'll definitely be seeing us again"".

We returned again in 2015 with the child who was in my belly (11 years old then) and his 2 other siblings! The service was a wonderful as the first time we were there.

Now living in Las Vegas, my heritage was on the other side of the continent. A couple of years ago when I was motoring on W. Tropicana Avenue I hit the jackpot when I laid eyes on Black Bear Diner. It was guaranteed I would try it. After two meals there I was impressed. However, it is a drive from Henderson to Spring Valley to enjoy a diner. But something happened. Santa Claus gave Henderson residents and myself an awesome Christmas present: a brand new Black Bear Diner. This would rejuvenate a former Chili's that had been a sight for sore eyes the last couple of years. 

  When I bestow 4 star ratings and the food is 3 to 3.5 stars, exceptional service or a unique environment could top it off to that level. In the case of Black Bear Diner it is the later. The bear theme is welcoming, entertaining, and unique. When customers walk toward the entrance, a family of bear statues are an omen of what awaits inside. In the vestibule there are couple of bear statues. Inside the diner, the bear motif is prevalent. However, this location is missing the menagerie of stuffed bears that make the Tropicana Avenue Diner a quasi-stuffed bear museum. On the table, the menu is displayed on newspapers. Nearby the menu is a history of Black Bear Diner that is rich in bear lore. In its own way, Black Bear Diner reminds me more of Cracker Barrel than a greasy spoon. 

  Being a diner, there are so many choices. I visited during dinner. I selected the meat loaf diner. It included corn bread with either a soup or salad. I went with the chicken noodle soup. It was fresh and delicious. It included mixed vegetables and a choice of potato. I went with the mashed potatoes with gravy. The abundant portion equaled quantity and quality. With a bottomless Coke, it came to a little over $16 before the tip which the waitress certainly deserved. 

  The waitress was friendly and professional. It was brought to my attention that a few Black Bear Diner employees from California were assisting with the grand opening. 

  It is worth mentioning that the kitchen is exposed, where the customers could see the cooks making the food. In a way, the cooks were part of the entertainment. 

  Black Bear Diner is down the street from me. I not only intend to return to Black Bear Diner a few times. I intend to try at least three different items from their menu then ultimately incorporate them into a review update that will be part of a list of  ""restaurant in focus"" or another name I come up with. But in the mean time, ""Happy New Year!""",17,0tvCcnfJnSs55iB6mqPk3w,188978607448,49

They text you 10 minutes before you need to show up, which helps if you're at a bar around the corner. 
We got seated at the bar, but we had lots of room to eat and drink. Prices are not unreasonable based on the quality. I had a great pizza. Still think Terroni is my favourite, but the crust was amazing...and they actually cut your pizza for you.",0,COxdRkjbxnvIDr-1NyiOhg,146028945291,67

If you're a walk-in who hasn't heard of them, you may be put off by the singular focus of this joint, but the chances are you'll become a convert when you taste the slow-roasted, succulent herbed pig. I'm a regular for their porchetta sandwich, or sometimes the porchetta plate with rapini, as the pleasing bitterness of the veg contracts wonderfully with the meat.

Sometimes they've been known to pre-slice the pork and fill your order by taking the pieces from an aluminum tray in the warmer. I prefer it when they cut the porchetta in front of me, with their electric carving knife, but I don't accuse them of leaving the pre-cut meat around for very long, so it doesn't dry out much. At least, that's been my experience.

After talking up the heavy focus on porchetta, I should add that their soups are fantastic - usually very heart and flavourful, best enjoyed on a cold winter day.",1,2TvKrJPSrOOmNlwxXonOPA,214748379537,70

I never would have thought that I'd be living in Las Vegas with the opportunity to try it!
I have taken my partner here on a few occasions, and love to bring guests looking for a unique, dessert experience.
This is not your typical dessert place. This is a sit-down, full-on experience! Be ready to sit down (preferably at the bar) and be wowed by the display of great service, beautiful desserts, and being able to watch them put it all together right before your eyes.
The menu will change seasonally, because there is actually an artisan pastry chef mastermind behind all of this.. *swoon* 
However, we only discovered this once we went back after our first time and my boyfriend's favorite was gone! So.. don't get attached. Be open-minded and prepared to try something new if it's not your first or second time there.
The flavors here are not typical- you won't find your favorite birthday cake flavor or even a triple-chocolate cake. This is a Japanese-French style, gourmet dessert place that serves unique creations with Japanese flavors in a French style.
We have had the opportunity to try most of their current menu and nothing has disappointed and everything has been carefully, flavor curated!
I recommend getting the $18 amuse with the main dessert. Otherwise it's $15 just for a single dessert. The amuse has been a light and refreshing sorbet every time and it does not disappoint. The flavor changes, so just learn to be excited.
They also serve a few savory dishes, which we have not tried, and they have a cute wine selection and pairing if you choose (I've done it once and it's really cute, but wine is best in wine glasses- not test tubes, unfortunately, but their dessert wine was DELICIOUS).

THE biggest heads up I will give you is: the parking sucks. 
Sweets Raku is in a tiny shopping plaza that has at least 6 other really popular food/drink places. A boba shop, a ramen shop, a KBBQ, a high end dinner Raku, and so much more. So be prepared to fight for parking unless you are going at an unconventional time (during the weekdays or in the early afternoon).

Other than that- Sweets Raku is a wonderful experience that I would continue to have time and time again because you can just tell that it's somebody's passion put on a plate right in front of you.",0,9qSqkary-DUI1vXqp0ebtQ,111669249220,75

Skewer pieces of meat, (poultry, swine, or bovine) hold them above burning charcoals, Crisp the edges and fatty bits, flip and turn until medium rare, set on slate and serve. The steps are undeniably simple, but the execution and creativeness is tricky. So when it's done right and in front of you, it's commendable.

Yakitori Kintori delivers on its promise of serving delicious and delectable morsels of meat and veggies on skewers. Perfect accompaniment to beer- the salty, juicy tastes of meat turn from good to great with every bite.

I ordered many things between two people and that's another positive about Yakitori, trading and sharing skewers. We tried different things like Japanese Yum (thought it was yam misspelled but it actually wasn't. It was still a potato-like-root), chicken oysters (aka. Chicken testicles), chicken tail (aka. Chicken ass), and etc. It can be a bit overwhelming as well because they serve literally every part of a chicken or pig from the menu, conveniently and anatomically illustrated with arrows to names-  balls are under here, ass back here and soft bone... here?

My favorites were the chicken testicles, duck breast, and tail. Lesser favs still worth trying were the Sasami mentei-mayo (which has nothing to do with sesame, in case you wondered), thigh and cheese meatball. On top of the yakitori are other options with rice and noodles or un-grilled like the octopus with wasabi. Everything I had I liked and the variety made the experience delicious. My advise is to try weird things and to see what is delicious before ordering doubles or triples. You'll be surprised with what you may fall in love with.

Pro tip: pass on the beer sorbet, as I mentioned in person while eating, ""Only somewhere like Guu can they serve this and have people accept it,"" otherwise it's just frozen shards of beer - bitter after taste with the only hint of sweet coming from the small dollop of whip on top.

Pro Pro tip: make a reservation because they take reservations. 

Overall, I really like Yakitori Kintori. It carries the Guu empire in the right direction not only in atmosphere and space (which is similar to it's first floor sister Kinton) but also flavors and awesome traditional Japanese food done in a unique way. Delicious and affordable, new and exciting come to mind after eating here.

You can definitely expect a different kind of atmosphere for each meal-time of the day. 

I ordered a spicy bloody mary and the Po'boy shimp sandwich. Both were PERFECT! The bloody mary was spicy, but not overpowering and just the right amount of salty. The Po'boy was fresh, shrimp was cooked to perfection and soft. Definitely adding this to my favorite meals. Our waiter was friendly and on-point with his service. 

Brunch is generally quiet, but fast service and you will definitely be taken care of right away. Lunch is average, but not too packed. Dinner is where the action is at. The open area outside is always lively with live music (in the summer), fire pits, waterfalls, and a very well stocked bar.

Rather than take the cards and process the charges later like other restaurants would do, they were manually calling in 1-by-1 each person trying to pay.

Once at a table, though, someone quickly took a drink order and plates did get cleared in a timely manner. The food was overall good. Meatballs were very good.

Typically, This is not an inexpensive meal your paying for the variety of meats and the presentation. There are always add-ons to up charge and increase your bill. Expect to pay $50 per person not including drinks. At this price point my expectations are higher than fast food so I hold them to a higher, refined standard to earn more stars, sadly they did not live up to the price.

I came in a lone without a reservation but was quickly seated, that was great since the dinning room was nearly full. I read the menu, people watched, started pyscho-analizing the sales technic of the wine lady, the photo girl and the way staff as they try to get people to take on the up-charge items. Why am I pointing this out because after all that I start fidgeting and realize I'd been sitting there 18 minutes without anyone approaching my table, now water or drink order, not wait staff visit, nothing. I had to wave down a waitress to get started, strike one.

The waitress makes not apologies and asked I fI know what I want surprised because as I mentioned the format is to offer you a bunch of other add ons and up-charging or upgrading your order. Most of the waiters I observed were working the crowd and doing just that, not mine, just what did I want. I placed my order.

If you have not been to one of these you choose which meat program you want and if you want seafood and other upgrades then head off to a mini buffet for your vegetables salad and other starters to fill you up before the more expensive meats start coming out.

Now here they really shine! Everything was great, interesting tasty salads, marinated vegetables, several soup choices that all smelled great, cheeses and some better quality deli and more. They want you to fill up on this so you don't eat as much of the higher cost meats to come.

The format in this places is to have a token on the table, often red on one side green on the other to let the roving staff with the giant skewers of meat when you want them to approach or let you rest. There are about a dozen meat choices that are supposed to be part of your meal. Here comes strike two.

Of the dozen meats I was only ever offered four. This was a failure of the management team, it was clear the staff had not pattern to follow or choreographed direction. They sort of wandered aimlessly offering meat to some people then disappearing to the back leaving many guests looking around in wonder. There seemed to be no reason or purpose, this is easily fixed and sloppy management of the dining room staff. This truly disappointed the most, meat is why you come to a Brazilian stake house, the format is variety of small portions that keep coming until you ask them to stop. They failed to execute the basic format correctly. I did receive tri-tip twice, garlic steak twice and both times they pushed more than a normal amount, bacon wrapped tenderloin, and roasted pork. I only got the pork because I finally asked for it and though I also asked for the lamb it never came to my table along with the rest of the selections.

Now for a few minor things which added to the overall negative experience. The tile floors were thick with grease and slippery, I saw and older fellow slip and fall near the rest rooms and I almost fell twice myself, this is unelectable in a higher priced establishment. Next the up charging water ($1) which was not a lot but thy try and say its a required surcharge from the city (its not). There were a number of other missed items not worth listing that all fall back to a poorly executed management team, poor coaching and poor monitoring to the dining room. 

Food was good, what I was able to sample but at $50 a plate and up I expect better service and professionalism. I cannot recommend this location as it's surrounded by better restaurants just feet away.

I had heard about the parking problem, but I was able to get a spot right out front. I immediately liked the crowd and the staff was very friendly. We decided to split the Fish Fry and the Chicken Alfredo and mentioned this to our waitress. The waitress was very sweet (I would guess she was one of the owners or manager). When our food arrived she had already divided the portions in half with each in it's own dish. That sold me on the place right there. Most places would have charged extra to do this and she did it without us even asking for it. The fish and chips were outstanding. I do think had that been all I had ordered the  fish would have been to small for the price. There were only two pieces (one for each of us) and at $14 that's a bit steep, but the sides were plentiful and tasty too. The slaw was surprising good. The hush-puppy was tasty as well and not dry at all. I am so glad that we ordered the fish, because if we had only ordered the pasta, I would never have been back. It reminded me of the $1 frozen pasta that they sell at the supermarket. It was really not good. I did rate this place with four stars though, so while the pasta was not good and the fish portions were smallish, I did really like the place and can't wait to try one of their famous burgers.

For those that have been to somewhere like Showmars, the idea is similar. Place your order, get a number, get food delivered. Even the friendliness of the staff is on par.

Unfortunately, the fast part was left out, because it can take a really long time to get your food. If it was upgraded to ""fast casual"", where you place an order with someone who later brings your food, then it might be different, but it still took a really long time to get the food delivered - I mean we're talking 15-20 minutes, way too long for something that should be going most of the day. And more importantly, when delivered, half of the dishes were cold - my guess is that they were ready within a minute or two and had to wait on (something).

Luckily, those friendly staff members did bring out replacements, though it took a couple tries to get someone who understood what we wanted - while the cashiers spoke both English and Spanish, the people cleaning the tables did not seem to understand English well (and we do not do much Spanish), so it was a bit hit or miss in this regard. 

The actual food, other than the wait and because of not getting certain ordered items, was not bad - but because it might be enough to warrant another trip to see how the fare. There were a few other tables that had piles of fried chicken, so that seemed to be a popular dish, perhaps it's worth a shot on another trip.",1,62GNFh5FySkA3MbrQmnqvg,206158494479,105

But I'm glad my family and I looked around for it, because the food is fantastic.  And there's a pretty extensive menu, if my memory is correct. The place has a lot of vegetarian and vegan options in particular, which is great if you have a big party and people who are particular about certain foods or ingredients.

She checked in on us several times in a nice but not irritating way to make sure we were happy with our food as well.  I do remember that if you choose something spicy, it will be very spicy.

We ordered the Dinner For Three (inexplicably $37.95 on JustEat.ca, since it is listed as $34 on their website) which allows you to choose a soup and three dishes, and comes with veggie egg rolls and a generous portion of steamed rice per person. We chose the chicken and sweet corn soup, Hunan tofu, veggie chow mein, and sweet and sour pork with pineapple.

I hear the soup and the sour pork were good, but being a non-meat eater I was left to the other 2 dishes. The Hunan tofu was lacking flavour but generally fine. The chow mein was mushy and looked like it had been sitting there a while.

If I have a plate of Zen's curry and rice in front of me, you would have better luck having a conversation with Stephen Hawkins without his computer.   Yeah, it's that kind of place for me because it's that good at Japanese Curry Zen.

The first time, I walked into Japanese Curry Zen was a few months ago, and they won me over on the first spoonful of their Tonkatsu curry and rice.    It was a orchestra of flavors, and the unique herbal blend created Beethoven 5th symphony on my taste buds; it was bold, smooth, and complex.   It wasn't too spicy, but Japanese curry Zen has a  number of condiments on every table to satisfied the more picky eaters.   I'm proud to say, I didn't need any extra raisins or extra spices, because the flavors stood on it's own.     One advice to the owners, Please make a sumo sized plate for those overeating Hawaiians :) because I could go off like the Yellow Gorenger from Himitsu Sentai Gorenger series in this place.   If you never seen that series, the renger headquarters was located below a Japanese Curry cafe like Zen, and that Renger would be pounding out 5 to 6 curry plates each episode.     

Zen doesn't have a large dining area, but I don't need a lot of time to eat here because I will clean out a plate within five to ten minutes.  The owners and majority of the staff are very genuine Japanese, and have that entire business spic and span clean.    Ouch!  Sorry Monta on that comment.

I'm a cab driver here in Las Vegas and I've been to just about every supermarket and specialty store as I love to cook.  The quality of the products here in Glazier's in amazing and while some of the prices may be just a little higher, if you check their weekly ad, you'll find more than enough things to balance out your shopping budget to splurge on really great items.

Glazier's has a weird habit of taking customer's recommendations and bring those items in (AWESOME right?).  You can tell which ones they are as they have tags showing that they are a new item which has been requested.  As I haven't yet found the need to request any particular item, I'm not quite sure how to go about doing this, but I'm sure the very helpful and attentive staff knows how.

They have a lot of items you can't generally find in other stores including UNOs frozen pizzas, a full assortment of Tastykake and Drake's snack cakes, a decent Hawaiian section as well as other things like frozen whole duck or a brick of Scrapple.

This is not your regular grocery store and even if it's out of the way, it's definitely worth going to.  I live almost 10 miles away and I'll make the drive at least once a week!",2,lL-wNa0TKK6LXrlcVmjYrQ,231928254012,141

Scaddabush is part of the Service Inspired Restaurants that include Jack Astors, Canyon Creek, REDs, etc. I think they just rebranded Alice Fazoolis that was at this location few years ago. They are still very similar but the rebranding and the addition of fresh mozzarella made daily and other menu options are highly welcomed changes, since I found Alice a bit boring.

The mozzarella is made to order, but only available certain hours (dinner time usually), try to get that if you can as an app. Stretchy delicious cheese. I've tried two varieties of it, burrata and bomba burrata, and they were both good although a little expensive for the amount. 

I also like their giant stuffed meatballs on top of pasta or on its own. The carbonara pasta is great, served with an egg on top, and delivered on a hot skillet pan. Also I tried garlic fries and crispy polenta tots, both decent sides. They come around offering to add parmesan cheese to any dish. Can't get enough.

Apple ravioli (pie) with ice cream was an okay dessert. Kinda small. The ice cream melted too quickly due to the hot apple pies, as expected.

They have great service here! Also nice decor with TVs. Usually they play music but during the last big sports game, we requested audio to be changed to the game since it seemed like all patrons were watching. The server did her best and made it happen.

I was here last weekend for a friends birthday dinner. There were about 20 of us and my fiance and I were the first to arrive. The first server we had explained their policy about splitting bills - they were unable to do so with large parties but she assured us we would be able to each pay our tabs from the bill and it would come off the final total. We figured we would just order the same drinks throughout the course of the evening to avoid confusion and went on with our night.

During the course of our dinner, we had MANY different servers which made it extremely difficult to figure out who was taking care of us. After ordering, our food came out promptly which was great given our party size. I always love the Tuna Poke, but this time we did not get enough chips and the chunks of tuna & cucumber were WAY too big to be scooped up. My salad was quite delicious but the chicken looked to be of the pre-cut, deli variety. 

Towards the end of the evening, we had a new server bring out the bill. I asked her if I could get a copy of it to see how much I owed so that we could pay for our items separately. She kept telling me that a guy from our table would cover the bill, and we could pay him directly. I told her that just wouldn't work for me, as I didn't even KNOW this guy, and I planned to pay with credit card - plus, the server before her told us we could pay for our items individually. She then told me to go to the ATM downstairs, she was ""way too busy"" to be processing ""20 different debit cards"" to pay for the meal. Ummm, excuse me? But that is what you deal with when you have a large party and a big bill (and therefore, an automatic gratuity). She was just being a HUGE bitch about it and I'm seriously SO DONE with giving Craft 2nd and 3rd chances when they keep royally screwing up. I'm sorry, but when the server wont even let me pay my own damn bill, I'm gonna be pissed off. Even writing this review has me boiling.

By the way, once the manager is back from appearing on Big Brother Canada 2, hopefully they keep him out of the kitchen. Otherwise, you can expect a disgusting amount of boogers in your food judging by the frequency in which he picks his nose.",14,eWyhZ-114SqkZkG0RyJG9A,120259177325,152

The cowboy beans were pretty good too.   

They had a band playing.  Pretty good, easy to listen to.  They didn't hurt my ears.

We had the choice of cooking our own meat or having the kitchen do that for us and we chose to let the kitchen take care of it! I was so hungry that if I had tried to cook anything, I might have just eaten it raw so this was a good choice haha

We ordered kalbi, beef bulgogi, spicy chicken, ribeye and pork belly. On the menu, there was also fried chicken, spicy pork and pork ribs. The portion sizes of each of these items was about a fist but its very variable because the second round of kalbi was much less. With all the side dishes that came along with our orders, this was a lot of food. The side dishes that we had was salad, potatoes, kimchi, fish cakes, and soybean sprouts. Amongst the meat - I liked the kalbi the best - it was tender and perfectly sauced. The pork belly was too fried and was hard to bite as a result. Among the side dishes, the potatoes were definitely my favourite. 

The cost was $28 per person and there is a charge of $10 if any item that was ordered was not eaten. At the end, I liked that they gave us the yogurt probiotic drink to wash it all down!

The service was very good, very team oriented.   Though I was pointing at what I wanted on the menu it took my server four guesses to get what I wanted.   It was impressive to me that he made sure!   Two waiters and a manager helped serve my table (I'm always impressed by a great team) so the service gets 4.9 yelp stars!

When I go German I want BRATS!!!  So I had the Two Brat Lunch Platter (may be called something else) with Sour Kraut and a side of Red Cabbage!  One of the Brats was Good as in Maybe 3.5 yelp stars which means I would not get it again!  The other Brat was OK maybe 2.5 (I'm thinking that is generous though).  The gravy with the Brats was good and the mustard was very good and spicy.  Goulash (not spelled as they did) was in a thick ""hunteresk"" type of homey (not the clown) gravy.  I took several small tastes to get the vegetables and meat and hesitate to give it a 2.25 yelp stars because I bet this is the flavor many people want!  Warm Sour Kraut was fresh (not canned) and was A-OK (3 yelp stars)  Warm Red Cabbage same story different flavor (less than three stars though).

For Dessert I should have gone somewhere else (and I did after I had it here).  The lady (maybe Manager/Owner? I'm guessing?) described the Black Forest Cake as being ""lite"" !

No doubt,  it's entertaining and fits in nicely at the Cosmo.

I've been here twice, both for dinner and once to see the show from the bar viewing area.  The space is lively and robust, its multiple rooms creating a slightly disorienting feel and complete with sliding blinds to separate the main room from the entry bar area.  It's modern yet retro, I think that's the best way to describe it.

What you see may not be real.  The two guys in suits emphatically discussing the super bowl contenders did it for so long that eventually I caught on.  There's old school stuff and a little burlesque.

Dinner holds its own very well and changes fairly frequently if I use my two visits as a gauge.  Seared foie gras, then au torchon, bone marrow, wonderful oysters rockefeller and sweetbread are my highlights.  Consistent throughout.  There's a great wine and spirits list, and service is attentive and friendly.

My first impression was that it was large. I mean, seriously. I'm used to intimate tea shops that provide for some cozy mingling amongst friends, but my friend informed me that this was the place to be at night (we were there early evening so it wasn't exactly bustling.) 

I ordered a lychee rose tea with tapioca pearls, and honestly I'm surprised at the price of bubble tea in these parts. In Vancouver my drink would rarely surpass $5 and it's size is the equivalent to what is considered a 'large' in Toronto. Here a regular size still clocks in at about $4 - too much for poor little me.

But back on topic - my drink was on the sweet side but so far it's the best bubble tea I've had so far in Ontario, which is saying alot. Overall, it's a nice place; there's a large selection of teas, calpis, and smoothies, plus food items like appies, toasts, and desserts, all for a decent price. I can definitely see this being a great hangout place at night, as there's ample space set up on the patio and indoors for groups.

However, you definitely get what you pay for at Top of Binions.  Not only was the prime rib so tender you could cut it with a butter knife, the ribeye (dry aged to perfection) was so well marbled, tender and flavorful not to mention cooked perfectly to order.   We also tried the lobster bisque which initially tastes rich, but with the chunks of lobster and perfect blend of cream  it went down so easily without feeling full afterward.  

The service was top notch! Our server and busser team (Oscar and Octavio) were amazing.  We never had a dirty dish on your table for any extended period of time, nor were our glasses ever empty.  They answered all of our questions about the menu with thoughtful knowledge and a smile.  My niece wanted to try the caesar salad but knew she couldn't eat it all, so Octavio even went the extra step of portioning it out for all three of us to enjoy.  Additionally, my sister and niece decided on the shared plate option but one likes their meat medium rare and the other well.  Oscar, without missing a beat said he would take my sister's half and grill it.  So it came back cooked to order with a beautiful and tasteful char on it.  

As we were leaving we asked Don Winn, the manager, about the glass elevator.  He mentioned that it was working the weekend prior to our visit.  We were a little disappointed, so he called it to the top floor, and while we couldn't use it, allowed us to step inside and experience some awesome Vegas history.

We decided to grab lunch while we waited and made the call to try Culinary Dropout.  Culinary Dropout is a part of a chain of restaurants from Fox Restaurant Concepts primarily in Arizona but across the West.  Culinary Dropout describes itself as a gastropub with ""creative cocktails"" and an ""inked-up"" staff.  It lived up to the description and it was good fit within the Hard Rock.

While we were looking over the menu, we started off with drinks.  I had the Maria Pepino ($10) made with Espolon Blanco tequila, spiced tomato juice, pickled pepper juice and garnished with an olive, pepper, and lime.  It was nicely balanced and spicy.  The pickled pepper juice made for a great accompaniment to the light tequila.  To accompany our food, I ordered the Last Man Standing ($10) made with Old Overholt rye and spiced tomato juice, served with a salt & pepper rim and a dill pickle spear.  Being a big fan of rye whiskey, it was even more satisfying than my first round.  For our meal, we split a pair of appetizers, the Black Mussels ($13) and Grilled Artichokes ($13), and the Korean Style Ribeye Cap entrée ($32).  We received maybe a pound of mussels that were fresh and properly cooked.  They were bathed in a flavorful broth made with spicy sausage of an undetermined type (I assumed chorizo), amber ale, and accompanied by a couple of slices of grilled bread.  It was a satisfying dish.  The grilled artichokes were less successful.  We received a single, small-sized artichoke cut in half, brushed with oil, grilled, seasoned with sea salt and served with lemon aioli.  While the artichoke really had a great grilled flavor, picking up a nice smokiness, from what I'm assuming was from a wood-fired grill, the small size of the head did not withstand the cooking well, drying it out, reducing the already small amount of ""meat"" to be found.  It was overpriced and a disappointment.  Our Korean Style Ribeye Cap (maybe a 6 oz. cut) was cooked perfectly to our requested medium rare and and seemingly topped with a red chili pepper, kimchi-style sauce and pickled vegetables and cilantro.  It was immensely flavorful.  Therein lies the conceptual problem with the dish.  The ribeye cap is nicknamed ""Butcher's Butter"" and is touted to be the tastiest cut of beef.  Sadly, the bold sauce covered up the meaty goodness of a cut that probably should've been left unadorned.  I liken the use of ribeye cap in this dish to that of making hamburgers with A5 kobe beef...a waste of a great piece of meat.  A different, less expensive, cut of meat should've been used for this otherwise tasty dish, which could've dropped the price by $7-10.

In the end, Culinary Dropout got its GED (Good Enough Dining).  Service was a strength as it was friendly, attentive, and really made us feel like welcomed guests.  Its cocktails were well conceived, well made, and a solid value.  The food, however, while flavorful, suffered from questionable decision making on how dishes were prepared and from pricing that did not offer a lot of bang for the buck.",3,le3Xn9Mheb1hNxWurF7RSw,300647744943,204

I found out about this place from the KTNV news website. They were doing a piece on Jet Tila's Kuma that just opened up. Over on the comments page, a few people were writing in that there was another place doing the snow ice, and it was over in Henderson. After a so-so experience at Kuma, I decided to check this place out the next day.

Frost Bites Shavery is a freestanding food truck that is located in the same shopping center as Friendly Donuts on Boulder Highway.. You can usually find them across from the China Inn restaurant. 

When I saw the menu, the first thing that popped out were the flavors, more particularly, black sesame. The owner, Mikey, gave me a sample to try. Let me tell you, I had an epiphany. Here is why. 

When I went to Kuma, I randomly ran into Tony T. As we ate our snow ice, he told me that it originated in Taiwan. He also told me how to tell the difference between OK snow ice, and an exceptional one. The most important thing is the texture. When you eat snow ice, it is supposed to melt in your mouth, almost like freshly fallen snow. At Kuma, when you eat it, you can taste the crunchiness as you chew, almost like a sandy texture. At FBS, after a couple of bites, it melts away.

 Mikey, the owner, told me it took him months to figure the recipe out, and he agreed that it should be smooth, and not a sandpaper feeling. He was also cool to let me try any of the flavors that I wanted. I took samples of the green tea and mango, and they were much superior to Kuma's. 

I ordered the black sesame with mango, and he even put condensed milk on it for no charge. The mango was perfectly ripe, and had a bright flavor. For the black sesame, Mikey actually grinds real black sesame into the milk, and lets the flavors infuse before preparing the ice, and it is phenomenal. It was a stunning snow ice.

I'll be back here because of the great flavors, an awesome, generous owner, and the best snow ice in the Valley!",26,gtwM4ijo65AN4DvXdgCu_w,188978650961,212

egg rolls seemed stale and had corn? really corn niblets? amen the culinary courage but not really appreciated. 

soup was just a  fish sauce in chicken broth with cilantro and a slice of chicken broth.  wayyyyy to salty with no balance of tradition. very small 6oz serving. (I may be exxagarating on size)


 basil fried rice was bland, chicken was flavorless, overall taste/flavor/freshness is poor. onions were oily yucko and zucchini and broccoli in thai fried rice???? really? 

eggplant with chicken was very good.  Overall blended, even flavor profile on sauce and ingredients.

panang curry beef comes in with broccoli and zucchini? really?  that's disturbs the overall  flavor  texture of the meal to no end.  also way too many carrots in the serving. the serving is already very small but insult to injury is almost cracking my teeth on small piece of bone in the curry.

yeah, I know  I should have taken a picture.

I let the server know but might as well be speaking kurdish. she didn't do shit and looked at me like I was stupid.  I am stupid for driving 45 miles one way to try this place with my family.

the only positive in the curry was slight detection of actual lime leaves and Thai basil in the curry sauce.

positive was the beef was tender and tasty, too bad for the stray bone. also wish there might have been some potato in the panang curry or just a hint more of lime leaves and Thai basil.

Overall service was very slow for 20% table coverage if that.

I really want to give a 3 for food quality, taste, appearance and freshness  but the bland fried rice, extra fillers like zucchini and broccoli, bone in the panang and combined with small soup and entree servings  sizes rate a solid 2.

New tips:
-I believe open mic nights have taken over both Tues & Thurs nights.
-Double Amaretto is tasty & refreshing. Request fresh squeezed lemon if you don't like bar lime. 
-Cash only. ATM on site by front door entrance. 
-Buffalo butter is their most popular wing sauce. I've tried it as well as Korean BBQ & red ale but I still prefer the classics like honey mustard. Their four alarm is a decent challenge to anyone who likes it HOT!

-Fox & Fiddle Finch, ""where everybody knows your name,  duh duh duhhh "" a la 'Cheers' 
-Always a fun and interesting crowd here,  even on a rare slow night.  Check out comedy nights and the karaoke night on Tuesday is epic.  Shaka is the best waitress they ever had and ever will have. Xoxo (07/82/2015 Update: Shaka still works here from time to time. Tip her well!) 
-There are 2 pool tables in the basement.  Plus a 2nd full bar, bartender, waiter service (when busy downstairs) , dart board & jukebox.
-Thursday $12.99 Nachos. Regular $16.99
-another drunken night of Tuesday karaoke... wow
-half-price wings on Karaoke Tuesday
-Have a live DJ sometimes (really approachable &  friendly). Yesterday,  Friday,  the DJ was on point playing a video mix of reggae R&b top 40 and hip hop.  Downstairs there was some unusual mix of pop and classic rock (I don't know who fooled around with the music)  but there's always the jukebox by the pool tables if you wanna play your favourite jam.
-Order any poutine from here and you will not be disappointed. I prefer the new southern BBQ chicken poutine. Fries, onion rings and wings are stellar. Nachos and Burgers are also  delicious. Even the butter chicken & naan bread w/basmati rice ain't bad - far from authentic,  albeit. Haven't tasted much else.

The restaurant is sadly mostly empty most times I walk past it (but it's survived for a while now) and their patio is nothing to write home about except for the fact it's a good people watching spot like any patio on Baldwin is. Much like ""Valens"" next to it, Sambuca has a large menu main but concentrates on the Italian side of things and in my experience, large menus tend not to bring out the best in the food. I was right on my assumption with my sweet potato purée appetizer being tasty but nothing special. My ""Atlantico"" pasta entrée was delicious, but the portion was too large (maybe not as a stand alone meal) and they could have done with just a little less sauce. But the salmon was cooked generally well. 

Service was quick and it should have been as we were the only patrons for most of our meal and our server was friendly, no complaints there.

A very mediocre restaurant when you consider it's food, but not a bad experience and prices are while it's not cheap it's in a reasonable range.

First, their breakfast food and sandwiches are still great.  That's probably never going to change.  But we don't go there for dinner anymore like we used to.  Maybe you don't order a steak at a place called Bagel Cafe, but the last two times my wife wanted steak (while the kids wanted Matzoh Ball soup and stuffed cabbage!), the steak was nearly inedible - gristly, thin, not cooked evenly, and I would hate to see the expiration date on the meat, as it tasted pretty rancid.  I can almost picture a ""Gordon Ramsay discovers something disgusting"" Kitchen Nitemares moment, covering his mouth over a trash bin after a tirade of expletives.

Which brings me to my other HUGE gripe about Bagel Cafe....and it's not pleasant.  The bathrooms...are disgusting...'nuff said.  Maybe it's a result of the huge traffic they get for morning/brunch, and they simply can't stop to check/clean the bathrooms during the day??  There's no excuse for disgusting bathrooms at a restaurant, and probably no greater turn-off, not to mention the health issues.

Clearly, dinner is not their target meal, though they still list many great specials, at least the nights they're open past 5 p.m. (any day except Sun-Tue, I thnk).  To be fair, the traditional NY Deli type items are still great (yes, I too love tongue, liver, whitefish, and other hard-to-find deli sandwiches; knishes, etc.).  Bagel selection?  Fabulous.  The pastries still LOOK as good as ever, but sometimes, after 2-3 bites, I wish they were less sweet, less BIG, and tasted a little more 'special'.  Matzoh Ball soup?  Excellent, if you like the rich, thick, ultra-brothy variety that sometimes even have the layer of fat/oil floating on top.  Now I happen to like that, but today's finicky health-conscious 2010 diner may be immediately turned off....and watch out for the occasional bone shard! 

My last gripe about Bagel Cafe?  The tabletops are too small!  Maybe I have a sense of false entitlement for comfortable seating, but with the huge platter-size dishes (and additional plates for 'sides') they use, a 4-top with 4 people, even when 2 are kids, becomes a challenge in space planning and creative plate stacking.  OK, maybe this gets people in and out quicker...but I have to note this here as a legitimate complaint.  The booths are slightly roomier, but not much.  I feel like I'm sitting in the back row of a Southwest 737 with my seatback and traytable in their upright positions....

I wish I could be nicer to this place!  The servers are friendly and fun, and the kitchen staff often comes out and yuks it up with the clientele.  Maybe they oughta have someone also make rounds of the bathrooms, too...   All this adds up to my first 1-star rating...

Oh yeah...someone else mentioned the cashiers.  YES, I've had problems related to this also.  About 2 years ago, I saw triplicate charges coming through on my credit card about a month after dining here.  They resolved the problem by running credits through after the fact, but I had to bring it to their attention.  Also, if you watch your account like I do, you'll notice that they take FOREVER to clear your payment, which is always an indication that their internal controls and policies may be lacking.",2,xuSHcXE_3IXoRyg5LObSpA,17179939132,227

Place is in a real hole. I mean, I'd NEVER drive into this outdoor mall area on a whim. But don't judge it from the outside. Interior is perfectly fine and clean. Recent expansion helps a lot. I was here in 2008 and found it to be wildly good, but cramped and hot. Not a problem anymore. 

Menu is diverse and complete. I like the ""jerky"" appetizer a lot, then moved on to the Tom Kha Kai soup, spicy thai salad, noodles, curries, and more basil noodles. Nothing was short of very good. Some of it excellent. Thai beers perfectly neutralize the flamthrower heat put off by those evil little green thai chiles. Easily the hottest damn thing I've ever bitten into thinking it was part of a green bean or something. I was sweating like Mac in the movie Predator talking about the ""same moon, different jungle"" while dry shaving his cheek. 

My single criticism is menu descriptions like ""Plar Dook O-Cha"" do nothing for this English only American. Waiters have thick accents and do not seem to follow requests of ""what is this?"" when pointing at the menu. But, that's really my problem being so ignorant.

I consider myself a margarita aficionado, and they have among the best margaritas that I have experienced. The beauty of their margarita menu is that there is something for everyone.  If you want an awesome margarita in the style that most gringos enjoy, order their ultimate margarita.  They make their own sweet and sour, and it is delicious and large.  If you don't care for a sweet margarita, order The Boss.  It is a more traditional margarita made with only a splash of sweet and sour, but mostly just tequila and lime juice.  Enjoy their home fried tortilla chips while you drink your first margarita.  They use both flour and corn tortillas to make these.  I usually eat all of the flour chips first, but never leave a corn chip behind either.

To go with your next margarita just pick about anything off of the menu and you will not be sorry.  I most recently ordered the Texas flat enchiladas. The taste was good, but I found the thick masa tortillas held a little too much of the oil in which they were fried and were a bit too rich for my taste.  My sister's mushroom and goat cheese enchiladas were yummy and different.  My lady's fish tacos were delicious.

Everything was delightful and they had Mochi as well, which my GF loves, but we were so full we opted out.

- Taste
We had seolleong tang, dogani tang, bossam, and nakgi bokkeum (and to-goed some fried dumplings).

First two soups were authentic and nice. I am pretty sure that they serve best tangs in this town.

For bossam, I think I can be a little more critical. I found them a little tough and dry. I believe that a better method to re-moisturize pork belly slices should be devised. Observing some signs of contraction and twist on the pork skin, I guessed that maybe the meat was not sliced just before being served, but was kept sliced for a while. Plus, they were not sliced evenly.

For nakgi bokkeum, I was really happy about its tenderness and seasoned-ness. It was a little too small for me but I really cannot expect more.

Fried dumplings (both Kimchi and Meat) were truely amazing. $20 dollar for 20? I think I could pay $30 for them.

Side dishes were all so good. I wish I could buy a pound of them each and bring them home.

They would not visit your table too often but it is fine (the place is not too big). Overall they were kind and friendly.

While the torta I got, the del-rey, wasn't bad it also wasn't fantastic. It tasted like what it was a hodge-podge of meats one would find in mexican food all thrown on a bun. It was hard to distinguish any significant flavors and the one I got the most was that of hot dogs. 

I probably would have held this place up a bit higher if I hadn't gone to a torta place near work a few days later and had a very similar sandwich that actually had some distinct flavor and I didn't have to wait with little AC for it.

Once they had Central Waters Black Gold on tap which is their bourbon barrel imperial stout aged for 3 years that was incredible to get a chance to taste, nectar of the gods, it usually otherwise sells out so quick! 

They often have beer dinners, which is about 3 to 4 courses, each paired with a beer from the brewery they are showcasing that night. They are a fun way to get to know a brewery, the food is pretty good, and decently priced for what you get. 

I did go one day to have a 1/2 off burger which they have daily M-F from 2-6pm I believe are the hours. It is a great deal but I thought the burger was just okay, definitely not bad but not the best burger in Madison. The mac and cheese is pretty tasty and customization for toppings. They have other specials and deals throughout the week worth checking out. 

Some of the bartenders there are super knowledgeable. They will be able to find you something new and fun to try geared towards your tastes. Most beers you are able to get a sample of if you are deciding to get a pour unless it is a brew served in a snifter since those are already just 5 oz.

The ramen here is interesting in that it is tonkotsu based yet have options of different flavors such as miso, shio, etc, but not plain tonkotsu.  They also have tan tan men but it was sold out so I went for spicy tonkotsu and my daughter tried tonkotsu miso along with a side of karaage.  

Tonkotsu spicy was fantastic.   You can definitely taste the rich tonkotsu base but the spicy miso with which it is flavored with added a thick kotteri flavor full of umami.   Excellently executed.   Tonkotsu miso was closer to tonkotsu than a miso ramen in my opinion and it was very good, probably better than monta.   As this is more of a tonkotsu place, it should not be compared to Sora.   Chicken karaage was perfectly done with a slice if lemon, flavored salt into which you can dip the chicken and a small salad.  

My only complaint is that I didn't get to taste the tan tan men and that it's on the East side far away from my house.  I would rate their tonkotsu higher than that of montas as I have noticed some inconsistencies in monta recently.

The decor: well it's British themed and beautifully done...home from home for me! I love the smell of this place, reminds me of my grans kitchen.

Head to the bar upstairs for football, generally they show English Premier League.

I love that tea and food are served in/on china cups/plates, that are mismatched. Again it reminds me of going to my grans house for dinner.

The wellington is out of this world, expensive but you will not be sorry.

Grab a group of friends, order from the feasting menu and enjoy Snday roast dinner!

Note: if you are ordering the feasting menu you need to pre-order before the Thursday of the week you are eating there and secure the reservation with a credit card. 

For Sunday dinner (feasting or not) reservations are a must as it is super busy.

As for desserts...Oh Lordy. The last time I went 4 of us ordered a different dessert each and shared, I remember we had a hazelnut/chocolate meringue, sticky toffee pudding, lemon sponge and the other I cannot recall. I have also had the chocolate orange tart. All I can say is epic! The homemade ice creams...ugh I need to stop as I fear I am about to drown in my own saliva.

I was sweating my crumbs off so I couldn't wait to get outta my car and into some A/C and eat some food. Turns out rice paper doesn't have A/C, i guess they can't afford it, its all good i've totes been there. However, they do offer some complimentary office fans, that they will gladly point in your direction free of charge (thankfully) to help cool you off from the heat outside. Very generous of them in my opinion, they hit that one out of the ball park. My bartender was a very stable, young man, probably in his early 30's and very confident. I first asked their permission to use the bathroom, they allowed, it was rather pleasant in there, almost a bit cooler then the dining area. I pondered for a short while if they would be upset if i asked to dine in the bathroom, seeing as the ambient temperature was a bit more tolerable than the dining area. I decided they might not want me to do that, so i never asked. The happy hour was pretty much a facade in my eyes, the big banner hung up outside is rather misleading in my opinion. The prices on everything are already so extreme, that the happy hour just appears to be normal pricing anywhere else you go. A $6 vodka soda isn't really anything a place should be bragging about for their happy hour. The food happy hour was even more insulting. Buttered noddles with a mint spring for only $9.5/7.5 on HH. Gee thanks rice paper. The pho price here is hands down, the highest I have seen in my 11 years on this earth. I asked the strapping young barman if the pho comes with a complimentary Iphone 7, he oddly enough told me, no it doesn't, it just includes the bowl of pho. I ordered the firecracker shrimp, tasted great, but it nearly cost my entire life savings. I guess I just can't afford this place as much as they can't afford an air conditioning unit. I'm hoping i win this weeks powerball, because then i certainly can say I will be back and i would love to order that pho.

I scratched my head last spring after seeing a couple of reviews and checkins and wondered why I hadn't seen it sooner. When I went in search of it, I understood why. It's a bit out of the way in the same building as tourism Calgary and if you don't know to be on the lookout for it, it's likely you'll miss it. But it's there! Open for breakfast, second breakfast, elevensies, lunch, and afternoon tea. Don't get any ideas about filling up for your 6pm dinner or 9pm supper though... These doors close at 330pm weekdays.

Now that the weather is turning a bit more nipply, (no, not a typo ;) )' may I suggest you start with a bowl of Matzoe ball soup - light broth, with a dumpling made from bread turned into crackers then rolled all up together. Hope you're bringing your appetite because if you follow up with a sandwich, you might be carrying half your meal out the door to save for your next hobbit meal. If that's the case, you should get the Grumans Grilled Special. It's my favourite, though the Reuben is sure to please and these folks might know a thing or two about making a Montreal smoked meat sammy.

If you want a new breakfast place to try, Grumans does that too! And don't worry about waking up early... It goes all day on Saturdays and Sundays. On my list to try is the Challah French Toast and Lox Benedict.

Oh, did I mention Grumans also does catering? Yep... You can spread the love for The drool-worthy goodness coming from this delicatessen at your next meeting or event.

Don't forget to get a side of hot au jus to pour all over your meat before you get down and dirty. That sounded pretty dirty on its own, but the only thing that can make your experience a little better is having a couple of french models on your side. 

A good way to go out of this place is making a stop at the desert bakery.  If you aren't watching the calories, definitely load up on the tiramasu. It will make any dinning experience a much more pleasurable one. I chose to skip the champagne brunch, and ended up paying $17.99 for lunch. Which was fairly reasonable with the overpriced Wynn and Bellagio buffets that are out there.

If you want a good meal before you hit the road and head back to Socal, this would be an ideal stop because you won't be eating much on that 7 hour traffic jam. I will be coming back to Le Village of Paris again.",1,nTcMFBHZV2vPnig0XLk-Hw,257698069082,328

Hot on the heels of another 5-Star recognition from Forbes, the plaque adorning walls both inside and out alongside other accolades, it was with warm greetings from General Manager Ivo Angelov that guests were welcomed moments prior to a 6:30pm reservation, the familiar staff once again found serving a full-house of guests from various backgrounds and several with time constraints.

Taking a seat in the dining room for the first time in over a year, a rounded alcove looking out on the Bellagio fountains better fitting a birthday than the usual bar seats, it was with carte blanche deferred to Chef Mardonovich that the meal began shortly after Cocktails, two old favorites joined by specially crafted Mocktails for a ten year old that made him immediately feel comfortable sitting amongst adults in his shirt and tie.

Dining under the big top with classical music playing lightly overhead, the room's whimsy and a veteran staff creating a refined environment that is anything but stuffy, it was shortly after the first bites of Le Cirque's White Chocolate Coffee Bread that an amuse arrived, the legendary Crab still available but seeing a rival for complexity in chopped Oysters served with a spoon of Caviar plus individual frozen Raspberry cells.

Moving forward to an enlarged version of Le Cirque's Yellowtail painted in Yuzu with textural toppings, the service outside a vessel without liquid better allowing the Fish to show its quality, course three once again presented Ossetra Caviar acting as a garnish, this time atop early-season Asparagus and citrusy Sauce that saw everyone including the youngster happy to eat their Vegetables.

Next reinterpreting a Le Cirque classic with the nouveau Black Tie Scallop, a plate dating back to Daniel Boulud's days in Manhattan as elegant as ever beneath shaved Black Truffles and Sauce Perigourdine, it was in follow-up that two new courses spoke of Mardonovich's training and perhaps Le Cirque's future, a tender slice of Dover Sole first crusted in Bread Crumbs and Sea Urchin with a stuffed ring of Marrow followed by Chicken and Lobster bathed fragrant Bisque with Carrots and Turnips smaller than a thimble.

At this point well-sated but excited by what was to come it was with plates centered on two proteins long-missing from Le Cirque's menu that Alan rounded out savories, the sizable Sweetbread seared crispy with an unctuous center made lightly sweet by Honey providing a beautiful juxtaposition to a stuffed Morel while rosy Duck topped tableside with Sauce Cassis found its dance partner in Chartreuse-scented Liver.

Quickly cleansing the palate with Le Cirque's liquid-centered Pineapple and Lavender ""Explosion"" plus a cup of Coffee it was once again a surprise to see a new Dessert despite no change to the posted menu, the Strawberry Parfait outpacing its predecessor in terms of subtle sweetness and layered flavors while the rest was highlighted by a Grand Marnier Soufflé flamed and then extinguished with Crème Anglaise.

FIVE STARS: No doubt a difficult task in replacing Wilfried Bergerhausen, though Christmas from sous-Chef Billy Maldonado showed well, it  seems Le Cirque has found their man in Alan Mardonovich to help push the Restaurant forward and if these preview plates are any indication it seems another visit later this season is  well advised.",12,U4INQZOPSUaj8hMjLlZ3KA,128849082608,335

The service is always amazing. Waiters are attentive with great recommendations and knowledge of the menu. 

We always have the hardest time picking the cheese fondue because you cannot go wrong. The pumpernickel bread they serve it with is my personal favorite dipper. 

For the entree we usually do the traditional bouillon cooking style and I like the pacific rim option that offers mainly seafood and a poultry. 

By the time you get to the chocolate you will be stuffed but it is so good trust me you will power through! We have a hard time getting away from the flaming turtle which is sinful but just like with cheese the chocolate is hard to mess up! 

It is pricey but worth it for the food and experience for a special night!

It was decorated as an English pub and had a bunch of flags and murals. We decided to have the firkin burger which was their signature burger and I am glad I got it. The burger was so big and packed with condiments I had to squish it. The patty was really juicy and tasted a lot like a stake. I wouldn't recommend you put ketchup on it because it kind of ruins the taste of the patty. Would you put ketchup on your steak? I'm guessing you don't. There is a spicy mayo that is spread on the buns and it is so good. My one complaint is that there is no free refills with the pop. The fries that came with the burger were so good they were crispy and not to oily. It sounds weird but the fries taste good if you dip them in the juices of the burger.

Sat at the bar.  I ordered the Bistro Salad without the turkey.  It came with baby spinach, huge chunks of goat cheese, spiced pecans, apples and sun-dried fruit with a sherry vinaigrette.  It was delicious!  One of the best salads I've ever had.  It was a little pricey at 13 dollars, but well worth it.  They also served an amazing bread with strawberry butter.  Yummmmm.

My wife's parents tell us, you have to try this Italian place if you get a chance! It's about 10 miles south of the strip on Las Vegas Blvd. in a casino called South Point.

We arrive and proceed to have some fun gambling, people watching, etc. Dinner time comes around on day two and we've planned to follow the advice of my parents-in-law and eat at Don Vito's.

We arrive at a much larger than expected casino and park in the parking garage.... right inside the entrance on the right is Don Vito's... very convenient so far!

It's a Sunday evening around 9:30 PM... not too busy at all. In fact, the place closes at 10PM so we're glad we got in when we did. The place has an old school charm to it, but it's not old fashioned. Tastefully decorated and well appointed. The staff is excellent... knowledgeable and personable. The waitresses' assistant goes out of his way to make sure we're taken care of. And I haven't even gotten to the food yet..

The food was excellent! We started with the Artichoke Franchese.. my wife wanted to compare it with her Nana's authentic Italian recipe. While 
it was pretty darned good, she said it didn't quite reach the level of her Nana's. The pasta fagioli soup was the best I've ever tasted.... flavorful, hearty, delicious! My wife enjoyed it just as much.

My main course was Seafood Diavolo on the recommendation of our waitress... it was either that or the Lobster Milanese. I think either would have been an excellent choice. The Seafood Diavolo was deliciously spicy and full of large plump shrimp and scallops, and huge pieces of lobster. My wife chose the Chicken Angelo... on her mother's recommendation, and with a little push from the waitress. She thoroughly enjoyed it as well.

Even though we were stuffed, we ended up ordering dessert... to go! Canoli and Creme Brulee... neither disappointed, even the day after.

The best part about this whole meal wasn't the delicious food or excellent service... it was the incredible value. This excellent meal with appetizer, soup, dinner and dessert was $65 for two.

I can't recommend Don Vito's strongly enough.. it's a little ways south of the Strip, but well worth the short drive.",5,zecq0D1C283rHNRKy2Ln9w,34359773091,347

They are always certain to walk to your table and make sure everything is alright, even though it is more of a southern bbq vibe where you pay before your meal, they still ensure you're enjoying it well after you've paid, sat down, and ate.

I returned here today, seeing as I live well out of town I make sure to always make a stop at the Hollow. They were incredibly busy, we decided to get take out, and we're not disappointed. I got the Brisket Sliders which comes with fries and a side (try the cornbread, it's fantastic). The sliders were moist, warm, and basically fell apart in my mouth. The fries were warm, not completely crunchy (which I like) and truthfully should have been upgraded to their Redneck Poutine, which is out of this world.

I have never had a poor eating experience from the Hollow, and I have been going here since just after they opened. It is a frequent of my friends, my family, and anyone who enjoys great, affordable food.

I understand that finding good Kosher food in Vegas isn't easy, and so I am super lenient when it comes to restaurants. I have also travelled all over the world, so I don't always expect the best service. That's okay. I have eaten here quite a bit over the last few years (even though it is badly priced, I try to support the Kosher restaurants here), and it has been getting progressively worse, and then this last time was the last straw.

I went with a group of friends. The waitress was rude from the get go, and we had to tell her twice that we wanted separate checks, because in the past they have told us that they can't do separate checks unless we tell them in advance. Okay. The prices for the toppings on the pizza in the menu is $0.50, and they charged my friend a dollar per topping last time, so I was sure to let her know, which did not endear me to her.

Then my friend, who had never eaten there before ordered. She tried to order fettucini alfredo with mushrooms, and because the menu doesn't properly portray what the ""Italian"" food really is, the waitress told her that what she had pointed to wasn't right, and she really wanted the chef's pasta.  The chefs pasta comes with pesto and tomatoes and was so not what she wanted, but it was $4 more, plus tax.

After we ate, and the food was pretty good, the checks came, and we tried to explain that what my friend ate wasn't what they charged her for. The manager came by, a blonde lady, and she tried to settle the bill. As I was talking to her, at my normal level, she told me to lower my voice, and that I was yelling at her, and then continued to disparage my voice, my tone, and basically my character. That was the last straw.

So, I can handle the slow service, the rudeness, the expensive prices and all the other BS that they have thrown at me. Why I won't ever go back is that the person in charge actually insulted me. Not quietly or presumed, but to my face, and that I won't tolerate. Panini...YOU SUCK!",0,o8jmcDLMHLBkSElzo0xquw,249108144138,387

I was determined to find something better, and I had walked past this place called ""Border Grill"" while walking from the convention area back to my car in the parking garage, so I looked it up on Yelp.  It had good reviews, so I tried it out for lunch the 2nd day of the conference.

Pros:
-Food is good and authentic
-Seating is fast and they will get you out on time to get back to work
-service is fairly good

Cons:
-a little rushed
-expensive, if you're not paying attention.

As I was seated, the waitress said ""Chips and salsa are coming, do you want some guacamole as well?:

I should have known enough to ask what it cost but I didn't.  I think they rely on most people assuming that it is free.  I was served a plate of decent chips and salsa, and then a huge plate of chips and guacamole.

I ordered the special smoked salmon bagel, which was very good.  In fact, it was extremely filling considering it sounds like a brunch item.

When I got the check, though, I saw the guacamole plate was ten dollars!  This raised my lunch from ~25 to about ~35 bucks.  Kind of a scam, if you ask me.

The waitress should tell you the price of the guacamole when offering it, I've never been anywhere that a guac+chips plate was more than 4 or 5 bucks.

I left a minimal tip (don't feel too bad for her, my minimal tip is 11%).  She should have told me up front what the costs were.

Ematei is somewhat hidden on St. Patrick Street, but not enough to the point that it's a well known establishment that gets very busy during lunch hours.

I decided to try this place after looking around restaurants on Queen Street near my workplace. The outside is extremely traditional and reminds me of those Japanese houses from the feudal era. The inside looks more modern, and while the restaurant looks big...there's really not a lot of seating area.

You can see what the specials are as you wait in the waiting area, as they are displayed up front. Their specials are actually quite affordable and are among their popular items in the restaurant. I went with the daily special, which on the day I went consisted of 3 salmon sushi, 1 butterfish sushi, 1 imitation crab sushi, 6 tempura rolls, and 2 tempura makis.

Normally I criticize sushi restaurants that overdo on salmon sushi, but the salmon quality in this restaurant is actually better than many other restaurants I've been to. The other sushi pieces, however, were mediocre at best. The butterfish sushi was okay, but the imitation crab sushi fell apart too easily for my liking. The tempura rolls and makis were decent, although a bit soggy for my liking.

Service was good. Even though I sat by the sushi bar (away from the waitresses), the sushi chef was more than happy to take my order and get the bill for me once I was done.

I'd be interested to see how the specials vary in this place, but overall I wouldn't be quick in returning here as nothing really remarkable stood out.",1,1kNsEAhGU8d8xugMuXJGFA,214748386816,396

There's a lot to love about Banter. For starters, plenty of seating, you have the option of sitting up at the bar to hang out with their friendly bartenders, or grabbing a table in the adjoining room, where you can grab bottled or canned beer at your leisure. Speaking of the beer cooler, holy selection! Some of my local grocery stores don't even have this much to choose from. I love being able to see the beers in person rather than looking at a list, and although they are marked up slightly from retail, it's still very reasonable. As for the food, you kind of can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. It's heavy, delicious food that compliments a beer perfectly (or the other way around, I'm not sure). My personal favorite is the plain fried cheese curds served with marinara. There's just something about such a simplistic offering that makes me happy. I have tried the poutine and some of the sausage sandwiches as well, my recommendation is definitely plan for sharing. The poutine portions are very large, and since it's so rich, I don't think most people would be able to finish it on their own. Also, I am an ""on the side"" kind of gal, I often order sauces and toppings on the side so I can add them a little more sparingly, and I do have to say that Banter goes OTT with piling up those dishes with sauce and toppings. Most people probably love this, but I think it's a fair point to mention that if you don't think you'll be able to finish the whole sandwich for example, you might want to order the sauces on the side so your meal doesn't get too soggy. For example, one of the sandwiches I ordered had BBQ sauce, and the whole sandwich was absolutely smothered in BBQ. The BBQ sauce itself was fantastic, it was slightly smokey with a a lot of spice, but I definitely felt there was too much for me personally and next time I would get it to dip rather than on the sandwich itself. Other than that I really like it here, very chill vibe for a weekend hangout and the beer selection is amazing.",1,oF_vwmhGi-JechfnimM60Q,197568515571,402

Service - 1/5. Awful.

I've been here on three separate occasions. Each time I've come back hoping that my experience will get better, but unfortunately, this has not been the case. Let me start off by saying that the food here is grand. Probably one of the best Korean places in this part of town, and with decent sushi (of varying quality depending on what day you come/who's making it). The first time sushi was delicious and excellent, the second and third times, the rolls were sloppy and way too big and they just didn't taste that great. 

The place inside is really nice-looking and they have a nice way of giving you a complimentary steamed egg with your meal. How nice! The caveat to such great food and nice interior, though, is the ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE SERVICE I've received every time I've come to Gogi. The servers are totally negligent. It is so hard to flag them down, they won't refill your water, they never ask you if you need anything or check up on you, they will blatantly busy themselves doing other stuff instead of stopping by your table once, even if the restaurant is empty. It took me FOREVER to get through dining here because of the servers. First it takes them forever to come around for your drink order. Then they'll leave and 20 minutes will pass before they ask you for your food order. They'll never refill or ask you if everything's okay (had to wait for almost an hour to ask for an appetizer, during which we changed our minds). Needed extra sauce or something with our food when it came... never came. Took forever to come and give us a check, longer still to come back and get the check. TOOK ALMOST THIRTY MINUTES TO RETURN OUR CARDS TO US EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE IN THE RESTAURANT. 

So I've come to hate this place because of the slow and negligent service I've experienced each time I've come here. I've never felt more ignored (sometimes blantantly, I'll make eye contact with a server and try to flag them down and they'll walk away) as a customer. If you really want great food and can stomach being treated poorly, I'll still say the food (not the sushi) is great.

This concept is not keeping up with the changing buying and taste patterns.

The room was very pleasant. Beautiful bathroom covered in marble. Lower level living room with full entertainment and great view of the golf course. Large and spacious seating area with work desk.

King sized bed and plush bedding. Comfortable and pleasantly firm mattress.

Room service was the highlight though. haha. Aside from the bathroom which is my main focus in every hotel I go to, the room service was definitely worth writing home about. Sure the corned beef hash sucked, but everything else was amazing.

Cobb salad
Chicken strips
Onion rings
Giant Belgian waffle
Super crispy bacon
Strawberries and cream
Yogurt parfait

I love food and I love hotels. I spent the entire summer living out of a suitcase hotel hopping and ordering room service.

It is really as strange as it sounds but kinda cool! They have this big patio back yard. I did not sit out there it looked so pretty. They had a singer out there who was good. 

The staff is very young and super attractive, hip. The patrons are all types. I had good service. I was treated very nice by all. I wasn't feeling well when I visited and needed time to kill before a gig. The waitress did not mind me sitting, reading, and being, all in all, pretty slow. I ordered the pretzels of course, because that is the talked about food here. Even for non cheese lover me, Ummmmmm, Hello? They were great but 10 dollars is way too much. Ouch! The homemade chips looked really good for a return trip. I did not eat any of the other food. I have heard poor things about the food here beyond the apps so I will have to come back and give it a try myself. 

A note on the server. She was great and very nice. However, she should not wait for a costumer to ask to refill drinks. I had to ask for drink refills. Still the service was much better than the other Yelpers have written about. The food came very fast too but again I just ordered the app. 

I liked it and would go back at least one more time to see what I think. I am not sure they will last though since they are way overpriced.

Ultimately, this might seem like a pricy place($110, two people with appetizers, mains and dessert) to many, but the price is what you pay for that guarantee of quality and consistency.  

As it is, Nora Gray serves Italian food, and you won't expect anything too experimental or anything too avant garde as they try to stick to rustic roots. Go with the bread as once you get it you can ask for more ENDLESSLY! This makes it great if you want to sop up any leftover rich sauces that are left on your mains.

It is very clean and crisp.  We ordered the burrito sushi .  Cool concept for sure.
You pick the fillings, sauces and fresh veggies.  You also have your choice of sushi rice or brown rice.  Then it is neatly wrapped up in a believe is a seaweed wrap.
The shrimp was fresh and the veggie choices were crisp and bright.  They give choices of things like cucumbers, sprouts,  onions, carrots and many other fresh choice veggies.  Then you choose your sauce.  Spicy mayo. Sweet chili sauce, and 3 or four other sauces (can't remember their names).  Then you move to veggies, then fruit toppings like pineapple.  You can add crunch at the end with choice options like sesame seeds, wonton chips, crunchy onion, and a couple other options.
It is then packaged in a cardboard (recycle-able) box.
The other option is to order the like in what's called a poke bowl.
Definitely want to try this out.  If you're not sure of sauce flavors ask to sample to dial in a complimentary flavor with your choice of meat filling.
I met Debra who manages.  She is warm and inviting.  She takes great pride in what she does.  I made a suggestion of something like tempura as an option.

Selection was dismal; some bland salads, some chicken dishes that look like they'd been there all day and ONLY dark meat to be found. Not a single piece of white meat in the entire building. A couple different desserts all which were extremely bad or extremely bland. Unripe fruit and defrosted, mushy ice cream. 

Zero Canadian food for picky eaters except for pizza. And not a single kebab to be found either although the website claims they are supposed to have them. 

The buffet itself is also very unkept; lots of serving spoons that have been dropped inside the curries or stews, and lots of dishes that desperately needed refilling

And let's not forget my number one reason for leaving this one star review:  $1.99 glasses of fountain pop with NO REFILLS. Are you friggin kidding me?  This place is a horrible value for the money.

Ghost Pines Merlot (2013): Astringent enough for a dry red wine, but it has a very round body and smooth aftertaste. It is a great wine for a casual dinner with friends.

I can taste that the tea is good quality tea, so I wish they wouldn't mask the quality of the tea with so much powder.

I would recommend to the owner that he/she put all the powders in the silver shaker, add just a little bit of hot water, enough to cover the powder, and mix it and liquify it before adding ice and tea and shaking up the drink, rather than just mixing everything in the plastic cup, which is supposed to be for the final product.

Tonight my wife had the Truffle Frites and the Beet and Blue salad. Not often does she belong to the ""Clean Plate Club"" but she signed her pledge card tonight. As she said, perfect dishes! 

I was deciding between the Pub Burger or the Brisket Melt. The choice was not easy but the Pub Burger won out....at least for tonight. It was requested cook medium and that is what I got.

They have a nice amount of entertainment here.  54 is a fun club.  ""Ka"" is a highly enjoyable Cirque show.  they have live lions here in their personal habitat.  I've heard of and seen pictures that they had a full theme park here, but that was before my time in Vegas, and I can only wonder now what that was like.  There are still tiny hints and remnants around the place, and I do remember it semi mid-transition.  It still has some ""theme"" elements left, like the recent ""CSI"" attraction that they added not too long ago.  It took the arcade's place, though there is a Gameworks right next door.

It's also in a good spot on the Strip, where you can easily walk to a lot of other casinos and venues, without feeling completely out of the way here.  that said, this place is huge.

It's a middle road between ""expensive"" and ""all access"" depending on what you want to do at the place.  But it's still very nice, and the staff, right down to the people who valet your car, have always been pleasant in my experiences.

I love the fact that they procure their poultry and (fresh) vegetables from local farms here in Arizona. My girlfriend is celiac and has to have a strict gluten free diet. We continually search for restaurants that are GF friendly. This is home.
On our first visit, I was so impressed with how patient and honest they were.
I mean, we must have talked for about 30 minutes (before we ordered), as to what is safe and what to avoid and how they handle the food, and so on...every detail explained.

The table linens are fresh and clean. No stains! Glasses, spotless! The silverware, no doubt, clean. Presentation of the tables have a classy charm, too. Whether you are single or on a date, married, or have a big family, New India Gate makes you feel welcomed and important. If you get the opportunity to meet Manuel, you will feel like he is their speciffically only, for you. He is a true gentlemen and very attentive.

I have my favorites....I won't share them. You will have to discover yours, on your own.

New India Gate is one of Chandlers most prized treasures in the city. You will not be dissapointed. 

Hope this review makes you want to dine there....I am so glad we found this place. Enjoy and bon appetit!",0,V-nBaK1iym_7VWD3fkIUFg,154618826873,497

The bread arrived to the table cold & the pasta was flavourless. I know it's a chain restaurant and I shouldn't expect much but I think Wendy's down the street would have tasted better and been less $$.",0,KQTICewpi87AnpSyNVBKrA,128849068572,498

The driver showed up after an hour and a half and was out of breath due to being out of shape. He looked like he didn't want to be here and was giving a ton of excuses on why he was late. I thought oh well maybe the food will make up for it. Nope! It arrived cold and messy. It was soggy and bland not to mention the appetizer sampler was gross and everything tasted the same even though it was suppose to be a variety. I couldn't even finish it I was so disgusted. Clearly, there was no effort putting together this meal. Thumbs down. Go to the grocery store and buy your own to put in the oven and it will be 10 times better than this mess.
I had to update my review.  I have been sick since I ate this food and I threw most of it out. I spent over $40 for disgusting food I couldn't eat and made numerous trips to the bathroom! Proceed with caution!",6,DG6ub7Z5-xX1JuYK-HPLiQ,188978627260,499
