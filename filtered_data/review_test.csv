Great customer service, and also very accommodating to my non dairy/non gluten issues. 
I had a very yummy Smoked Salmon and Egg brunch. 
I would have loved to stay for a Cappuccino, but alas, they do not have Soy. When I mentioned it to our server, he said that he has tried to encourage the management to get some, which was really nice to hear.

Changing it to one star now because I got a great comment from from the place about how ""EVERY pizza place has a delivery charge and it goes to driver and I'm a cheap ass""
No, no, every place does not have a delivery charge. Especially a 5$ charge for less than a mile. And the driver told me he does NOT get the charge for himself which is why I tipped him 6.58$ on top of the delivery charge. So if you say he is getting more than a 20% tip for not even restaurant sit down service, and acquired it through means of manipulation then o am correct in my assessment of not patronizing this place in the future.

My husband and I went to Kame Omakase last month to celebrate our 1 year wedding anniversary. 
For this special event, I looked at a lot of other competitive restaurants but Kame Omakase stood out to me with their gourmet ingredients and beautiful presentation that is more than just ""omakase sushi"".
I was lucky to snatch a seating for 6pm on a 3-day weekend and I loved that they send you a detailed text confirmation immediately to reassure a crazy planner like myself. They are also very upfront about the pricing which is very nice because no one likes hidden fees.

2 hours at Kame Omakase with Chef Eric Kim was excellent. 
I loved the intimate setting of 8 seats that lets us interact with chef while watching them create beautiful food art. Every thing we ate were described to us from their origin to how to eat the dish. 
I went to culinary school and I am a big foodie but trying ingredients I haven't even heard of - such as different types of ""momo"" = peach from Japan with freshest seafood blew my mind. 
Chef Eric really put thoughts into each course to bring out the natural flavor of every ingredient and also created art. Honestly, everything was decadent and both my husband and I were thoroughly impressed.

I also liked that the food was brought to the table, that was a nice touch.  If only they could make the parking lot a little more efficient...  Four stars for the good grub and solid value.",2,bAdsFiJbGiRzBzhSTUD_2A,68719568578,963

We asked the other waiter to bring us back some change but he never came back with them, assuming that whatever was left from our bill was for tips. I DON'T THINK SO, MISTER!

I've been going to this place since I was still in U of T (4 years and counting) and I noticed that their quality (both in food and service) has deteriorated SIGNIFICANTLY. And forget about the quality, even the quantity has been reduced significantly as well. $6 for a small mediocre pho is just not worth it.

There was about 3 20-something year old guys that waited a short while then went down the hall to go outside for a smoke. Lady at the door called out to them repeatedly if they want a table, but they didn't hear. I like how eager they are for business :)

As usual for a HK diner, lots of similar sounding items and menus and specials to plow through.

Husband and I got baked rice with seafood and chicken as well as the club sandwich to share.

The baked rice was the first thing to come out within 5 minutes, which was surprising since I thought it usually takes longer to prepare and 'bake'. It's the size of a small oval casserole dish meant for 1, but there's really plenty to share for 2. At first I thought the cream looked too wet like soup, but it's actually works well with all the egg fried rice at the bottom. There were lots of fish and chicken pieces, which were fried before baking under the cream and cheese coat and was tasty and tender. Rice had plenty of fried egg in it. Overall, the taste was perfect. This may sound silly but it may be the best baked rice I've ever had in a Cha Chan Tang. I hope it doesn't disappoint next time I order it again (now I'm hesitant to try something else :) ).

Club sandwich was average. What can I say. It's good if you want the sandwich with the all the works that's a cha chan tang can provide. Bacon was crispy. I'm not a big fan of mayo or too much miracle whip so I scraped some off.

Both items included drink so we got 2 yin yeung (tea and coffee mix). Hot and smooth, quite good, and definitely better than what I got in cha chan tang in HK while living there for 2 years. Surprising. They also ask if you want the drinks at the beginning or the end. I opted for the end so I can enjoy it fresh and hot. You just need to remind them when you are ready.

Service was quick. They did forgot my meal soup (chosen Chinese soup because cream soup might taste like what's already on my rice) but understandable in a busy environment like this. The servers were middle aged ladies that took their jobs serious, responded quickly and served without rudeness.


Baked rice with seafood and chicken, with soup and drink was I think about $6.99 on the lunch combo menu. Club sandwich was part of tea time special, for about $5.49. Sorry, it's been a few days since I ate here.


Overall, it's a nice neighborhood place for me that serves up good HK comfort foods at good value. I will definitely come back.

Omakase is the Japanese term for trusting the chef to come up with an enjoyable meal whether it's sushi or a classic European cuisine.  It's an exciting way to try the more creative and special dishes from the chef's knife.  It requires about two hours for dinner but well worth the time.  When you order, you'll be asked about allergies and this is a good time to mention the types of seafood that you don't like.

If your party is four or less, I recommend siting at the sushi bar.  We luckily sat in good view of the lead sushi chef and watched his amazing knife and prep skills.  He was very focused in his tasks but explained each round of courses personally.  There is a high level of construction/presentation involved with each dish so I was in awe of his techniques.

One really surprising thing was the appearance of black caviar, white truffle slices, kobe beef, and foie gras during the run of courses.  All those fantastic flavors in one sitting.  My friends and I opted for the $150 per person course.  There is a $200 option too.

If I have a 5 Star experience, I am almost always trying the business again before reviewing them.  If I have an experience with 2 or less Stars, I'm either not wasting my time with a review or I'm trying them again before reviewing them.  I'm also not one of those Yelpers that give a negative or very positive review just to be contrary.  That being said, Wingtime is hot, new, and already has a 5 Star Yelp average.  I have to admit, I was very skeptical about the ratings.  Really, they have a 5 Stars average already?  It's just chicken wings, right??  Then I found out for myself why this place has such a huge fan base from the neighborhood locals.  First off, their chicken wings are fresh, never frozen, and cooked to order.  Secondly, their wings have a lot of meat on them.  Substance is a huge deal to me when it comes to food in general, including wings.  I prefer a wing with more meat, less breading, and ironically, no flavors.  I don't need a wing drowned in flavors to hide a skinny, meatless, and tasteless chicken.  The wings at Wingtime are so good that their flavors and rubs are really not necessary. But if you must know, Wingtime has at least 14 different flavors to season your wings.  I tried their Peanut Butter & Jelly Time Wing, which is crazy good if you're a peanut butter lover.  Their garlic parmesan is actually my favorite and I recommend it.  Wings and chicken fingers can be purchased by themselves or in a combo.  I recommend the Fingers N Wings Combo for $11.59 if you're undecided or a first timer.  This combo includes two chicken fingers, 6 wings (2 flavors), choice of fries, Texas toast, and a drink.  This meal comes with so much that it's good enough to feed two.  I have also tried their grilled and crispy chicken sandwiches.  Both are not currently on their permanent menu, but will be soon.  The grilled chicken sandwich is really good, fresh, and is about 6 oz. of chicken breast.  In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with either their wings or the grilled chicken sandwich. 

The restaurant is very clean and service is top notch.  Don't be surprised if every single employee, including the owner Lance, acknowledges you, greets you, and checks up on you.  I also warn you that Wingtime is very busy and there's usually a long wait for their delicious wings.  They get a lot of phone orders, take-out, and people dining in.  Keep in mind that Wingtime is not fast food and everything is cooked to order, not sitting under a lamp.  I know this and will call in my order if I don't have the time to hang out.  

Overall, I highly recommend Wingtime to all wing lovers out there. Their wings are plump, never frozen, and cooked to order. Wingtime has at least 14 different flavors to choose from, which make them the overall ""King of Wing"" in the area.  5 Star Yelp Average???  I question that no more.  5 Stars from me as well. 

TIP #1:  Be patient or call in your order.  Wingtime has become a local favorite and it's busy. 

TIP #2:  14 different flavors, including specialties like their peanut butter & jelly, Ensenada Chilada, Berry Hot, Orange U Happy, and the very hot Ghost of Habanero.  

TIP #3:  Located a couple of footsteps from Salted Malted

TIP #4:  Wings by the piece start at $7.99 for 8. Chicken Fingers by the pieced start at $6.99 for 4.  NOTE: Each finger is about 2 oz. of meat, 1 oz. of batter. 

TIP #5:  Combos start at $9.29 and come with wings/chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast, and a drink.",13,y3FcL4bLy0eLlkb0SDPnBQ,8589941600,911

This one has enough ingredients to make it a satisfying meal. It is not cheap, but I couldn't make it at home for any less, considering everything that is in it.

Fortune Cookie is one of my workhorses.  I've never set foot in their dining area (and probably never will) yet they've consistently served me some of the best Chinese food I've had in Charlotte. 

They get a glowing 5 stars from me for many reasons:

1) They're easy to order from over the phone
2) The food is never greasy or heavy
3) You can taste the quality of their ingredients
4) They always deliver quicker than they quote
5) Every member of the staff is friendly

There's a good selection of dishes on their menu, so everyone should be able to find a taste they like.  My favorites have been the Chicken Teriyaki appetizers, Crab Rangoon, and the absolutely killer Singapore Mein Fun which I think is their best dish hands down.

Hubby got pho, and loved it.  It's served in a huge bowl, and he ended up finishing the whole thing.  The broth was so rich with flavor, and the herbs were fresh.  In other reviews, as well as when we were there, the owner commented on his orange chicken.  I decided to give it a try, and I'm so glad I did.  It's served with a side bowl of sticky rice and broccoli.  The chicken was wonderful, it was crunchy, but still tender.  The sauce was amazing!

They've been open for 2 days now and I figured it would be a mad house.  I was there around 4:30pm and although it was busy, they had plenty of cashiers and there was no line. (I had a friend who went around 12:30 and said that it was a 45 minute wait, so be prepared to wait during peak lunch hours)

The staff is all very friendly and helpful and there is a large menu just as you enter.  There are also paper menus at each cash register. As you order, you can see into the kitchen, which is always nice.

They seem to have more than enough staff to cover the opening. It appeared as if things were (basically) running smoothly. I did see a couple of hiccups while waiting for my order, but everything was fixed immediately.

I ordered take-out and it didn't take long for my food to be ready. The food is all reasonably priced, unlike most Strip restaurants.  The cashier gave me my receipt and a buzzer to notify me when my food was ready.

They have a couple of areas of counter space where you can get ketchup, mustard, napkins, mayo, etc. They even had to go cups for the condiments, which is nice.

The décor is super cute.  There doesn't appear to be tons of seating, but there are low tops, high tops and booths, along with a small round bench for people waiting for take out.

Now for the burger....I ordered the double Shack burger ($7.99), which is a very basic burger with 2 patties, cheese, lettuce, tomato and Shack sauce. I also ordered a side of crinkle cut fries ($2.95). For being ""no frills,"" this burger packed major flavor.  Consider me impressed.  The fries were also very good. I like that they are fat and not wimpy like some other places.

My coworker ordered the 'Shroom Burger, which is vegetarian. It's a fried Portobello mushroom, filled with both cheddar and muenster cheese, topped with lettuce and tomato and Shack Sauce. I love meat, but this seriously looked and smelled so delicious that I can't wait to try it.

I also can't wait to go back for the desserts - they obviously specialize in shakes, but they make theirs with custard instead of ice cream.

They have a great beer selection, and I love that they have made an effort to support local businesses (Bad Beat Brewing has a beer on tap and Gimme Some Sugar's banana peanut butter cheesecake is in the All Shook Up concrete).

They are also active in the community, with 5% of sales from the ""All Shook Up"" concretes going to the First Friday Foundation.

I expect this place to be very successful, and they are off to a great start!",9,rKkpHJkJ27xOwnhy_bMkvA,257698041827,896

I had a turkey burger which was cooked perfectly with a garlic aioli bibb lettuce tomato and I added some cheese. Bun was perfect on it.  I could order a side salad instead of fries with no extra charge.  It's was mixed greens and a great vinaigrette with tomato shredded carrots and radish.  My friend had a medium rare burger which was perfectly cooked with fries which were just the right amount of crispy and great herb seasoning.  I couldn't help but steal them off his plate!  Didn't even need to dip them in a sauce.  And the soup was perfect.  It was a cream based soup with I think ham potato mushrooms and seasoned perfectly.

Management doesn't see that? 2) Another female employee (didn't catch the name tag), came out and opened up three cartons of blueberries & just threw them in the bin so that Marita(?) could continue making salads.

The day before he knocked a trash can over that was also very avoidable. And another cabinet on the other side as well.

I was in Charlotte for business and was eager to experience their BBQ scene.  I was told that I had to try either Midwood or Mac's first.  I chose Midwood which was a good call.

Decor is Texas shabby-chic.  The place was packed from when I entered to when I left about 2 hours later.  Expect a wait unless you choose to sit at the bar, which I did.  But lets move on to the food.

Food is insane.  When I'm in a restaurant that clearly knows their stuff I'll just turn the keys over to my server/bartender and tell them to bring me the drink and meal of their choice.  This was a good call.  Melissa, the bartender took great care of me.  Everything from picking the best IPA in town to letting me sample their burnt ends.

Brisket was incredible.  It doesn't come served with a slice of white bread like many BBQ buffs might be used to, but I can forgive that slight difference.  Sides were also amazing:  Bacon Wrapped Jalapeno's and Hush Puppies.  Geez... why am I not there right now?  I'm wasting my life...

Small disclaimer, milage may vary with different locations and different meals.

Example, the last time I was there, my first serving of brisket was excellent, juicy, tender, could cut with a fork but it was only enough to just get started.  I knew I wanted more brisket so when it was time for my 2nd serving of brisket I asked for 2 big pieces. Big mistake because they were both extremely dry and salty, and these were not end cuts. I couldn't even make them better by dunking them into bbq sauce or au jus.

Soups and salads are ok, you cant really mess that up. Desserts are also ok.  Avoid most of the food on the left side of the buffet, it's the sides and misc stuff, they don't always look fresh.  The sandwiches are ok though.  

Like most buffets they have a different theme each night, though most of the selections are the same every night.  Turkey, brisket, and roast beef seems to be there every night.

I had a Groupon to use and had heard great things about the one that closed in Cave Creek so wanted to try the newly opened one in Scottsdale near us. We were seated right away and the waitress came to us right away to take our drink order and a bottle of water to share. The food on the menu is not your typical food but more on a creative side. They all sounded good and wanted to try little of a lot of things so we opted to order 5 small plates. The couple at the table near us was complaining about the size of their dishes so we were concerned if we ordered enough. The manager came out talked to them for a while, and comped their entire bill to make it right! Even though they were using a Groupon, he said to save it for next time, this one is on us. Now that's a great service!

Anyway, the small plates were all very generous. They were creative, beautiful to look at and so, so delicious! Very fresh high quality ingredients were obviously used. The prices on the menu is comparable to other restaurants with similar ambience and quality of service. We asked for some bread because I've read on the reviews it might take a while for the food to come out. That in itself took a while but I saw that they must've baked these ""melt-in-your-mouth"" biscuits as ordered, we understood why. They were served piping hot with delicious butter to go with. All other plates came out soon after. Everything was delicious and worth the wait. The waitress was very attentive but not obtrusive throughout the dinner.

We wandered over to the food court. Being that I have been eating clam chowder regularly (not sure why I always have cravings for it nowadays), it was an easy choice for me to want to try the Lobster Chowder Company. As one would expect, it wasn't cheap. But hey, do you really think Vegas would offer anything at a low price?? It was still probably cheaper than the clam chowder you get at the outdoor window at Disneyland, if that's any consolation.

We ordered both the lobster corn chowder and the clam chowder. Both tasted decent and standard -- nothing amazing but it wasn't bad either. I personally thought the clam chowder was better, though it did taste pretty similar to the lobster chowder. The bread bowls were pretty small though compared to bread bowls I've had at other places. However, this is not to say that the portions were tiny -- one bread bowl left me pretty full!  We also ordered a portion of french fries, which turned out to be the crinkly cut kind and boy do they give you a LOT. Volume-wise, the amount of fries was larger than a bread bowl of soup.

We were so pleasantly surprised on how friendly the staff was. They came around table to table asking how we were doing and if we needed anything else. They brought around napkins and toothpicks, without being requested, too! Awesome service, I'd say!",0,7KsXJ8MvU9VIG78W10s0SQ,292057808850,866

The lentil soup had so little lentils and so much pork in it that they should change the name.  It was also not very good tasting.  It was another dish that tasted like it came from a mass-produced facility and the same herbs that they dumped into the red sauce.  If you list a chicken dish that is dipped in Romano cheese and sauteed with tomatoes, you assume the chicken was sauteed, no, it was FRIED, tasteless and not worth a second bite. I had the steak with mashed potatoes. The steak was acceptable, but if that is the only good dish, I'll go to a steakhouse. The potatoes had a very bland potato flavor, needed salt for some flavor and looked grayish-brown that was not very appealing to the eye.

Pricey... but the meal is worth it. For my first meal in Montreal, I had the good fortune to share it with the reigning reine of the City of Saints, Risa D. As I wandered through the narrow streets and alleyways, I wondered what she had in store. As soon as I opened the door, heard the strains of an awesome Spotify playlist and smelled what was going on in the kitchen, I knew I was in for a good night.

Set in what looks like a hip hunting lodge basement, L'Orignal is original. Behind us was a Montreal version of the Sex & The City ladies. To our right was an older man and his young, buff male escort. Further in the dining room was a rowdy table of Canadian bros. Never would I think to put all these disparate types together, but it works. All this observing and judging made me thirsty, so I began the evening with a Grape Escape cocktail. For a time, I was on a muddled grape kick so this vodka concoction really fit the bill. Not only that, but it was a nice pairing with my soupe courge (that's butternut squash to you non-francophones). Warmed up and feeling good, I ordered the pasta of the day (rabbit cavatelli) and a robust Bordeaux to accompany it (Château Puy-Landry). The pasta was a revelation. Living in New Orleans for a few years, I'd had rabbit more than a few times and I was never that big a fan. Going with the dish based upon the recommendation of our waitress, I held some skepticism. It was for naught. The cavatelli was delicious and the rabbit bore none of the nasty gaminess I remembered. In fact, the meal was positively decadent and spot-on for a chilly night in Old Montreal/Old Port. Be aware that taxes run high and tip isn't included in the meal (I'm used to getting gouged with auto-gratuity in Miami).",10,cufhYFdyrUAt4SWe-m0grQ,51718,858

The cashiers do not seem knowledgeable about whats being served on a given day or what they're out of.

The only reason I ate here is because I had a half off coupon, and I'll never eat here again. You know your buffet is awful when a customer is leaving it hungry. Sam Boyd would be rolling over in his grave to know this buffet is in one of the casino's associate with his name. To start off, my experience was so bad, I called to speak to a manager after my visit. I was connected to Imelda. I'm sincerely hoping she isn't the manager because if so, both her and whoever gave her that job should be fired. From the start, she was condescending, rude, and kept interrupting me. The conversation ended by her calling me a liar, and me telling her to forget it, and that I'd contact Boyd corporate instead. My visit started by me getting sat in a booth with food from the previous person still on the seat. When I got up to the buffet, I had to search through the stacks of plates to find just ONE plate that didn't have food debris the dishwasher didn't wash off. I went at 12:15, yet the food was inedible from how long it had been sitting. Between the dirty plates outnumbering the clean 12 to 1, and the luke warm food that was hard on the outside, mushy on the inside, I had no desire to eat here. Frankly, I was afraid of food poisoning. I stayed maybe 10 minutes as I forced myself to pick at a couple plates to try getting my money's worth. I had a coupon for half off my buffet, and still left feeling ripped off. Obviously, I'd left hungry since I'd only had about one small piece of fried fish, 1/2 a piece of Salisbury steak, and 2 pieces of cantaloupe that didn't taste like fruit. I grabbed a burger to go from In-N-Out to eat when I got home. Unfortunately, I never go to eat that burger because before I could get home, what little food I did eat, to put it nicely, cause a bathroom accident with what I thought was just a fart. Now I feel especially ripped off because now I'm out the $7 I spent on the buffet, the almost $3 on my In-N-Out burger, and a pair of underwear. The experience with Imelda made it even worse, and ultimately ruined my afternoon. Based on how rude she was to me, I strongly dislike her, and the food was so awful I wouldn't even make HER eat it.

The busers serve you drinks and guess what, mine was not paying attention when he put my water cup down and it spilled ALL over me. WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS, ARLENE! Luckily, I had already put my Louis bag on another chair and was not wearing anything expensive. A supervisor came by to ask if I was okay, and I just said that I was fine and that it was just water. Of course, spilling a drink on someone is unacceptable and that set my mood for Market Street Cafe for the rest of the trip. Unfortunately for me, I was staying at the Cal and had meal vouchers for this 24 hour restaurant.

On to the food. The oxtail was NOT the absolute best thing I have ever had. Yes, it was fall off the bone soft, but it was so fatty. Plus, the ends were dark colored as if it is old meat. The soup is salty and they skimp on the vegetables. Also, for all the mess that we make eating the dish, I wish they would provide an extra small bowl for the bones. I like how they put the ginger and cilantro on the side so we can add it to our taste liking, plus I prefer no cilantro at all.

My favorite time to eat here is breakfast. Do not get their prime rib scramble since it is probably leftovers from the night prior. I like the made to order omelettes but my absolute fave is the Philippine breakfast. It comes with tocino! The busers in the morning come around frequently to refill coffee, but never asks to refill my orange juice. My last morning they tell me that it does not come with free refills. Well that was my first time hearing of that, and if my cup is empty, why wouldn't you even offer regardless of charge. Stay consistent people. I have gotten free refills on OJ before! I do not care about the charge. I just want to stay hydrated in the 101 degree weather!

Lines are long, especially at 11pm when the oxtail special starts, but it moves fairly quickly. The vouchers do not cover everything. For example, oxtail is a dinner voucher plus $2. Sometimes they apply less than $2 to your meal and you pay the balance. It's confusing.

I went here on a Saturday evening around 5pm.The restaurant is located on the top floor of Dragon city mall.Don't expect this place to be super fancy, the elevator to the restaurant is old and the restaurant itself is very old looking but it was clean and had a very calming vibe maybe because the restaurant was nearly empty.

I went here with my daughter and we were actually wanting to eat a mid day snack and thought of a dim sum date on a cold evening.

The ladies out there were super friendly and since it wasn't too busy we ended up chit chatting with a few.Service they gave us was beyond amazing.They kept checking on us and refilling our water.

So we ordered shrimp har gow, egg noodles, honey garlic ribs and shrimp and chive hockey pucks.The har gow was super fresh.The ribs were the highlight of the meal, they was so succulent and tasty wow.The eggs noodles were basic but added to the meal and last but not the least the hockey puck were delicious.All are food came out in timely manner and was super fresh and hot.

When here don't forget to ask for their hot sauce and chili oil both are the bomb.

All this we ordered came down to $24.I will definitely be coming here again.And I highly recommend this restaurant.Next time I want to try a few more things like crab claws and their mango pudding.",33,HpcqeJwnBCTZhMgPpUsslQ,77309423022,840

Rosé. Rabbit. Lie. Is a modern supper club...a dinner and a show...something of a dying breed of establishments. A throwback to 40s & 50s, it's a modern twist on a classic tradition. They have an elaborate selection of modern interpretations of classic cocktails...including the use of clarified milk. The wine list...wowzers. If you can't find something on there you don't belong near a wine glass! I opted for the Sezarac...an adaptation of 1950/Langford old fashion...it was pungent and powerful and the absinthe rinse really set it off!

The food is served ""tapas"" style...meant to be shared; The portions are a bit smaller and guests are encouraged to order a few things for the table. The short rib poutine was my favorite of the dishes we chose. Short rib, fingerlings and cheese...how can you go wrong? I've heard great things about the caviar tacos but I wasn't brave enough to try them!

The desert menu included a tapas style dessert called the chocolate atrium...which includes various chocolate delight served under a giant glass dome...the presentation looked fabulous...the apple butter cheesecake jumped out for us and we opted for that. We were not disappointed!

And now...the icing on the cake...the entertainment! This is the real reason I wanted to come here. Every night, about every hour or so, they have live entertainment which includes a 4 piece band, singers and dancers...this is what sets this place apart. These musicians and dancers and true entertainers, engaging and entertaining the entire room.

Each time I went the food was actually really good, so I decided to order catering, being that the food was really good and the service was good the last few times I went.

Apparently the service changed, and this is where they lose me as a customer.

A few days ago I tried to order catering from this company for a small party.

My husband had gone into the restaurant 2 days prior to me ordering, just to check out the catering prices. They had a new menu posted on their wall inside the restaurant, the man at the counter even pointed it out to my husband and said ""these are our new catering prices"". The prices on the menu had the tax included on them, so we knew exactly what to expect for our budget.
My husband even took a picture on his phone, and showed it to me when he got home.

So a few days later, I called them and kept the order simple, ordered five trays: 
two types of rice, two types of meat and noodles.

When the lady on the phone told me the total, I was in awe!

I did the math by the prices on their new menu, added the delivery charge, and tax, and the order was way off....by almost $70!!

When I requested that she repeat everything back to me, she broke the charges down by what I ordered and the prices were NOT what they had posted on their menu, they were higher.

I confronted her and told her that the charges she quoted me were not the prices that  they had on their menu and that my husband was in there a few days ago.

She laughed and said that is not what they have on their wall.

When I told my husband the total he was enraged.

My husband got on the phone and asked to speak to a manager.

A guy came on the phone, let my husband tell him the problem, and then said ""We give you special price"" and quoted him a different price, that was still higher than what they had posted on their wall. 

My husband said ""That is not what you have posted on your wall in your restaurant, I was over there 2 days ago, all we want is the price you have advertised"".

The man said that they cannot give us that price, he didn't even explain why.

The man on the phone sounded like he didn't even care, he didn't even try to help us.

So we told them no way, and cancelled the order.

They have lost me as a customer. 

I am not going back there. 

If they screw up like that, it makes me wonder how future orders would have been for me.

I'm not asking for much. I just wanted some good chinese food for my party and now I have to start from scratch.

We consulted several smartphone apps and a friend for recommendations but we still couldn't decide where to go. A friend suggested we try the neighbourhood around Queen and Ossington. I had heard there were some good restaurants around there. With so many choices, we still couldn't decide where to go but settled on Hungry Amoo because it had good ratings and an interesting name.

The space looks trendy, cozy, and intimate, with dim lighting, exposed brick walls, and patrons dining by candlelight. Very nice.

Our server was very helpful in explaining some of the dishes on the menu since we weren't very familiar with Iranian/Middle-Eastern food. He also told us that Hungry Amoo means Hungry Uncle. We chose the Tamarind Beef as an appetizer, Whole Roasted Eggplant as an entree and two of us chose the Kebob.

The Tamarind Beef was pulled brisket with roasted cashews and cauliflower, date sauce, and garnished with crispy lotus root chips. Delicious and very nicely presented! The meat was tender and the sauce didn't overpower the dish.

The Eggplant was also very nicely presented and colourful with the yoghurt sauce on it. It must have been good because there was nothing left. I did, however, get to taste the lentils and liked the flavours.

The lamb Kebob was perfectly seasoned and cooked. Delicious! The jalapeno puree added a perfect little kick and the pickled corn had a nice acidity. The couscous was perfectly fluffy and buttery!

Overall, we all agreed that the food was excellent! The ambiance and service were equally impressive. The chef/owner chatted with us for a while. Nice personal touch. We would definitely come back.",0,Ao-6FYE29-I8WwPg67806A,60129545753,831

I've had a lot of fun nights here. It's a great place to go for a birthday. It's tiny inside though so you may not get a table and even if you do you are in pretty close quarters. I've never eaten there but it's always packed upstairs on their patio during the weekends so my guess is that it's good. They have a good downstairs patio too. I prefer to go here once it's already dark outside, I just feel like it's that kinda place. It's pretty old school. Another fun perk is that a lot of wedding parties will come here (it seems like from out of town) and get wasted and fight and cause a bunch of chaos. That has been the case on NUMEROUS occasions and has always been entertaining. Probably not to the best man who got kicked out of the wedding the night before at the Grapevine, but it was for the rest of us.

they were OKAY. the menu was super exciting to look at but the overall experience was mediocre.


my bf and i ordered (we ate half and then swapped) :

""the Californian"" (half a avocado and two full slices of bacon in the omelet and some jack cheese on top) 
  -it tasted good, but it wasn't anything special, probably could have made it at home for less than i paid for.

""the GVP"" ( lil mushroom, lil spinach, half avocado and muenster cheese topped with sour cream) 
 - wished there was more filling to it, it was mostly egg. tasted almost the same as the other omelet.
 
it comes with toast or coffee cake and hash browns or potatoes. 

when i first saw the plate i was surprised at the portion size!
... but then  remember how much it cost.   $10.  

i left that restaurant filling unsatisfied.

by all means the quality is much better than denny's or ihop, only if you want to shell out the extra bucks to pay for it.

When I ventured in here, I got stinkeye from the three tables of college-aged hipsters sitting there (what is it about hipsters giving everyone who isn't a hipster stinkeye? Get over yourselves already.) The venue itself reminded me of these college town pizza bars I visited up in Corvallis, Oregon years back. Except Plaid isn't a pizza bar. Or in Corvallis. It's a world-fusion mishmash veggie-friendly restaurant in Tempe. Or something like that.

I was served by the owner himself, who was the sole server of the evening for several tables and was a very nice guy but he seemed very nervous and I wasn't sure why. His nervousness proceeded to permeate my mind and that kind of made me feel nervous. 

Like, why was he nervous? And now, like, why am I nervous? It's like some psychoanalytical flu virus. I became slightly uneasy.

Anyway, the entree menu is really random: spicy Singapore noodles, Jamaican Jerk chicken, Bombay cauliflower curry, Plaid Thai noodles, all with options of chicken or tofu. The flavors are so extremely varying from one dish to another that you sit there and debate about whether any of them could actually be good. I was a little dubious about how the food was going to be, but I went with the scheme anyway and opted for the spicy Singapore noodles with chicken, which the owner assured me was very good.

In the interim I paid a visit to the graffiti-strewn bathroom and then looked around Plaid as a whole. Bar to the side, 2nd-hand couches in the middle, conga drums just sitting there. The leather seat of my own booth was pretty  worn down and when I'd lean forward, it would lean forward with me. I don't think that's supposed to happen. I then proceeded to thumb through an old edition of the Phoenix New Times because it seemed appropriate. .

My bowl of noodles and a 1/2 pint of AmberBock greeted me at my table soon after. The noodles were decent, and there was giant mass of them, but they weren't remotely spicy. I could taste the curry powder but that was about it. I then walked across the room to get some Sriracha to kick the noodles up a little, which to me made them more palatable. The owner then came by my table to ask how I liked the food. I didn't know how to respond. I wanted to say ""This is awesome stuff"" but it wasn't awesome stuff so I settled for ""good, thanks"". 

That all said, I'm probably far from the target demographic for Plaid. I mean, places I thought were amazing when I went to college would probably be met with a different reaction had I gone to them for the first time at my age now. But I could easily see how this joint could be a student favorite.

Now I'm not saying Plaid is a bad place. It's extremely vegetarian-friendly where every dish can be made with tofu instead of meat, so that's a big plus for the soy product-inclined, and the owner is a very friendly guy and my meal plus 1/2 pint together equaled $9 and change. Wallet friendly, especially to kids on a student budget.

But this place was kind of awkward. I felt kind of awkward. Which is, well, kind of awkward, because that's not at all what I was expecting when I was heading over here.

3 stars. Would be a worth a return journey if I lived close and was a junior at ASU.",2,AKXqbuifvfvNEpr3Qs51hQ,68719494223,816

In saying that, knowing that we were going to Bouchon for brunch, I was still very excited. I can honestly say that breakfast is pretty much my favorite meal of the day. I chose the croque madame for my love of sunny side eggs and buttery brioche. I learned from Mr.Bunnie's culinary school days that a well-cooked egg possesses no color of evident cooking when fried, poached, over easy, scrambled...you name it. And after many dozens of eggs tried in mastering this process, I, too have learned to appreciate egg cookery in a whole different light. Just look at the perfectly cooked sunny side up egg drizzled with mornay sauce drowning my beloved layers of brioche toast and sweet salty ham. Delicious!

As much as I loved my dish, I loved his dish more. Mr. Bunnie has made quiche for me many times before and I've always told him it was the best that I have ever tasted. EVER. However, once the soft moan of satisfaction escaped out of me, slight appearance of goosebumps on my arms, and the faint closure of my eyes, I have to admit -- I have a new love. The hint of sweetness from the pillowy custard grounded by the layer of perfectly baked buttery crust was pure heaven. Tender creamed leaves of spinach set stage for a perfect balance with the custard that just melted in your mouth. At that moment, he knew as well as I that as much as I love his quiche, I will probably never utter the same adoring praise ever again.",1,WhAJCrMwgaT2KB3EASCmTQ,120259155432,809

I didn't like the raspberry dressing much and the waitress brought out the emulsified vinaigrette instead. That worked much better. I brought a whole box of salad home.

He then came to our table just to tell us that we have to pay up at the cash registry.  Why couldn't the waitress just tell us that?? 

2.  Demetre has decided to remove dollar signs and decimals from the prices on their menu items and resorted to using fraction of 1/4, 1/2 and 3/4.

The fiancé and I love good BBQ places and saw that Rollin Smoke Barbeque has beef ribs, not that common where we're from so we knew we had to splurge and substitute for them! We opted for the trio choice of 3 meats: beef ribs, spare ribs & brisket (sliced instead of chopped). This was $17.99 + $6 sub for the beef ribs & it came with cornbread and a side - we chose the bacon potato salad. 

Our food came out super quick and was a big portion, definitely enough for 2 people. The bacon potato salad was so good! The beef rib (only one rib) was disappointing because it was immensely fatty and the brisket (~5 pcs) was even worse because it was sooooo dry. Brisket is supposed to be tender with an amazing smoke ring but theirs failed at both. The spare ribs (2 pcs) were good but didn't fall off the bone. I liked the bbq sauce, not super thick like some places. Corn bread was meh, if you like light and cake-like then this is for you. I like mine super crispy at the top. 

The location was kinda sketchy and in the middle of no where it felt like. There are some communal tables out front and two small rooms inside with a handful of tables.

With that being said I understand not all dishes are as spicy as others so I won't pass any judgement here. My wife got the woon Sen and hers was spicier than mine and she had a 2. 

We will certainly return but wish the portions were larger and the spice was more consistent.  I also wonder what the atmosphere is like when the weather is poor given that they lose 75 percent of their seating when the porch is closed.

His new establishment, Makitto, is small but comfortable, and it pains me little to make the drive across town knowing that his sushi is the destination.  He's very particular about the fish he orders (i.e., making sure that certain species come from specific regions) and is happy to make recommendations or create something special for you if you feel like trying something new and different.

Their customer service has been excellent, even in these early days, as the staff has always been genuinely friendly and very attentive.  On the weekends, I'd recommend arriving as early as possible as they're likely to fill up quickly although I doubt a wait would be very long (as others have noted, its located right next to the Cinemark 16 movie theater, so it's a great place for date night!).

Makitto is quaint, clean, comfortable, and the kind of place that one goes to when the priority is really great sushi.  I could make no greater recommendation - I just cannot think of any sushi restaurant in the Valley where the quality and presentation compares.

On this last time, I had the tri tip sandwich, and the two of us shared some fried pickles and spinach and cheese dip. We also each got a Hurricane, as suggested by our waitress, and ended the night with banana pudding and bread pudding. 

Phew! So I had always wanted to try their tri-tip, but never wanting to be up for something messy I got it that night. After putting some bbq sauce on it, it was super tasty! My friend got the brisket, which he had to put half away when he first got it since it was so good and he wanted to take some home. The apps were also good, but I'd never had spin dip without artichokes, so I thought it was lacking. 

Hurricanes - very good. Didn't realize we didn't get happy hour prices until we got the bill (we weren't seated at the bar), but it was well worth it.

This place is hip with the majority of the patrons on laptops and/or hanging out with friends. The server was courteous and suggested the early grey snow with the candy fluff. The snow itself with the earl grey tea was quite tasty. You definitely taste the earthy tea flavor and the sweetness level was just enough to qualify it as a dessert. The snow texture was super fine, so it melted easily upon eating. I enjoyed that aspect of the snow dessert.

The candy fluff was ok. It was not cloying sweet like most cotton candy, but it adds an extra texture to the melting snow in the dessert. Maybe better for taking pictures or wearing as a Santa beard as I did for fun. The wooden spoons are neat, but they were a weird shape so when you scooped the snow and ate it the spoon didn't glide smoothly empty.

The rest of the restaurant was empty. The remainder of the review might give you a hint of why.

We ordered an order of pork dumplings to share, and we each ordered two special rolls. The pork dumplings tasted like raw onion powder. The sushi had its own issues. It arrived smothered with sauce; I used my chopsticks to scrape some of it off. I'm used to having sushi with a little drizzle of sauce. Also, thinking back on it, the proportion of rice to other ingredients seemed to be too much. The diameter of the sushi pieces was extremely large. Each piece was so unwieldy to pick up, let alone shove the whole thing in your mouth without having it break into pieces. At least the sushi was edible, once the sauce was removed.

When the server took our plates away and asked us how everything was, I said that the taste was there, but the pieces were hard to handle because they were too big. She told me that's because they were special rolls. I literally had to bite my tongue, because I have had special rolls many times at other restaurants, and they never looked like sushi on steroids.

A lot of the food comes SPICY so if you cant handle heat maybe this isnt the place for you.

Favorites include the BBQ shrimp (it's not BBQ in the non-New Orleans fashion, it's sauteed in lemon and spices), etoufee, red beans & rice with double sausage and hot sauce, chicken po boy, fried oysters, really anything fried-- the breading/batter they use is amazing.

Dishes that didnt quite stack up to the real New Orleans versions-- mainly the gumbo and Jambalaya.  Something is missing, cant put my finger on what.  Shrimp po boy is too light on the shrimp, and they're missing a good roast beef po boy-- of the best things I've ever eaten in New Orleans (from Gene's).

They are typically well mannered children, the older one (who knows how to talk) always says ""please"" and ""thank you"" and my younger son (1 years old) on average hardly makes any noise because he's too busy stuffing his face. 

However, any child can have a bad day.

My younger son was sleeping when my mother in law decided to take us to Applebees after a day of shopping. When he woke up in Applebee's he was clearly taken by surprise. He wailed loudly, and the waitress came over. She had already gotten us settled with drinks and we had placed our food order. No backing out now. ""Do you want some warm water for a bottle?"" she inquired politely. We thanked her and she went to grab some water. 

Meanwhile, my older son who was drawing quietly on his kids menu got a little overzealous and knocked his soda everywhere. When the waitress returned she didn't look the least bit annoyed and went to fetch a towel, smiling and talking to the kids all the while. At this point I was uber embarassed and ready to high tail it out of there, but she made me feel much more at ease. She chatted with us about her three boys and told us stories about back when they were in diapers. The food came out quickly, I ordered the Won Ton Tacos (usually an appetizer) as an entree and it was great. 

Applebee's is family friendly. From food to atmosphere they're a great option for when you can't get away from the kiddos. Although you can get much higher quality food somewhere else, I don't think I would overlook them any time I want to take my kids with me. They have Weight Watchers endorsed food too - and it's tasty!",3,UcR01xQcUpF0ZqkAvwO2Nw,163208820352,702

This restaurant is located right by the Mirage Atrium, Fin, and the Cravings Buffet. It's design was very hip and trendy and that's what the Mirage was transforming into from it's glory days as the most luxurious hotel ('89) to just an average joe hotel.  

But anyways, we ordered the Signature Platter, good for 4 - 5 people and came with fresh fish; Tuna, Salmon, White Fish, Mackerel, Halibut, Shrimp, Squid, and Inagi. We also ordered miso soup and edamame as our appetizers. The food was terrific and didn't disappoint as well as the service being top notch. Sitting in the lounge area was just relaxing, having a flat screen TV with the game playing or laying back on the soft leather seat and admiring the Mirage Atrium.

Their lasagna is so good that I have dreamed about missing a slice of their meaty, cheesy, saucy goodness.

(All I know is that when my bf and I made homemade lasagna, we spent almost $80 on all the ingredients. But maybe we splurged too much on expensive cheese idk lol) 

A slice of lasagna here should set you back $9. Not bad because it is a pretty hefty serving. I always have to take half of it home, especially since it's served with a piece of garlic bread.


We also tried the cheese ravioli. Scrub mistake. Order the meat ravioli because the ravioli is already good, but the meat takes it over the top. I love their red sauce so much I could drink it.

First of all, I'm a big fan of buffets. I had Le Village @ Paris (breakfast, lunch, dinner), Bellagio (dinner), Mirage (dinner), Seafood buffet @ Rios (dinner), and Spice Market (lunch & Brunch). My favorite used to be Paris, but the quality of buffet was on a free fall and I swear off as of last year. 

Now let's talk about the Buffet @ The Wynn: 

Deco: The best from all the buffets I had. Very open space with natural or what feel like natural lighting. Lovely plants and great paintings all over the dinning area. 

Service: Depends on your servers. We found the previous diners gave $2 change for tips to our server. 15 mins and no drinks later, I understood why. However, the new server at dinner time was much better. 

Variety and Rating of food: Of course, it's no Spice Market, but still sufficient. I only gave ratings to the food I tried. 
The buffet is divided in areas-- 
Cold seafood: lunch: chilled soup, smoked salmon etch (N/A) 
dinner: peeled shrimp and Alaskan King Crab 
legs (""B+"" for the huge shrimps--reminded me 
of the good old time @ Le Village)Japanese: Yes, the sushi selection is just sad (""C"") 
Fruit salad/speciality salads: love the salads (""B+) 
Chinese: worst from all the other buffets on selection & taste (""C"") 
Mexican (lunch)/Mediterrean(dinner): (""B"") 
Grills: (N/A) 
Craving station (same Prime Rib for lunch/dinner, leg of lamb for lunch and lamb chop for dinner): Prime Rib was good. leg of lamb was overdone, lamb chop was much much better (""B"") 
American: (N/A) 
Italian: lunch (B-), dinner (C+) 
Pizza: (N/A) looks great 
hot Seafood: (B-) 
Soups: 4 variety but too salty (""C"") 
Salad bar: moved from the first station for dinner. 
Deserts: not a true beauty! Everything looked great but nothing compares to Bellagio. The crepe was just bad--Paris had the best.

Papadum is a thin crispy bread often served as an appetizer or snack, very much like how Mexican restaurants serve nachos as a snack. As I waited for the waiter to bring me papadum to snack on, my appetizer arrived. After taking the first bite, my first thought was, ""ahh it's cold!"" I do not know why I expected the Chaat Papri to be hot, but that it was cold surprised me and made it less appealing to me. Considering all the ingredients that go into this dish, I found the tamarind chutney to overpower every other ingredient. I also felt that the wafer to sauce ratio was off and more than ever I wanted that papadum to break off and dip into the sauce. I could not wait any longer so I called the waiter over, and by that I mean I waved my arms in the air because not once did the staff make eye contact with me. Once the papadum arrived with a side of coriander chutney, the waiter promptly removed the chaat papri sauce that I had planned to eat with the papadum. I took a deep breath and tried not to get annoyed. I could have asked for it back, but I was becoming too frustrated with having to seek out their attention.

......Overall the meal was great.  I could have skipped the appetizer and dessert and still been more than happy with my meal. In fact, that is what I am going to do next time I visit, skip the appetizer and dessert. Yes, I will return to The Host because simply put, the naan and butter chicken were that good.  I will however come with friends. As annoying as it sounds, many restaurants give you much better treatment when you come with a party than on your own. It is ridiculous really and if the food had not been good, I would be telling everyone I know to stay away.

The wait staff are super nice and laid back.

They allow dogs on the outside patio which now has seats too, so that's been great for us to stop by for a drink or snack while out walking our pup!

Cons:
The food can be inconsistent. In the past 5-6 times we have been here, the wings are a staple that we order. I'd say the last 2-3 times they came out in like 3 minutes after we put the order in, and they were cold and had a funky aftertaste? I dunno if maybe a lot of them get cooked at once and they just sit under a warmer? For what they charge for 6-7 wings and garnish, I'd gladly wait the few extra minutes to get them fresh fried?

Aside from the food though, this is definitely a place where you could walk in during the day, have drinks and hang out, and not even realize it's already the evening. Great dive bar vibe, I'd recommend checking it out if you live in the area.",1,ySrgGSc7u9FzHaPX7vpgOw,180388676727,646

Their greek food is absolutely amazing. You will forget about the food court greek food after you've been here. Their souvlaki with potatoes and rice are absolutely amazing - their potatoes are marinated in some tomato base and really adds to the flavour. It's also a huge portion - two people can easily finish one plate. 

The burgers are freshly made. I will agree with the rest of the comments, it is made well-done so there is some charring in the meat. That being said, their burgers are a thousand times better than the chain. 

The two men who work there can be grumpy sometimes - I will admit. Just a little rough around the edges but genuine people. It's just the two of them - they make great food and yes, they work long hours.

It always looked so cozy and romantic; beckoning me to drop by. This past weekend I finally got a chance to come in to celebrate my boyfriends birthday. We sat at a charming table by the window, the sun setting after a light rain, a candle between us. There are few restaurants that have such an atmosphere and I'm always grateful when I find a gem like this one. It was quiet and warm and the wine list was endless. 

The dinner menu was overwhelming. There were so many delicious options that I think we must have sat there for 20 min just trying to make a decision. We finally decided to go with the severs suggestion of that evening specials: Chilean sea bass and veal chop. We definitely made the right decision, the presentation was beautiful and the food was phenomenal. 

Overall I had a great evening at Domani. It is the perfect restaurant for an intimate setting. The server was lovely and the restaurant owner, Paul, personally came by to ask us how our evening was and if everything was up to standard. I really enjoy going to a place that is so welcoming, we will definitely come back very soon. Especially since we couldn't leave without enjoying a slice of homemade tiramisu! 

I've read the old reviews for Domani before making this posting and I can honestly say that since Paul has taken over the restaurant (end of last year) it has upped itself in standard and class. Some may find it to be a bit on the pricier side but you definitely get more than what you pay for, and you really can't compete with the quality.

Now it's almost midnight.  You're hungry, but you're also not in any shape to drive.  Well, if you're fortunate enough to live within walking distance of this joint, you're in for a treat.

Right when you get past the parking lot, you feel like you're in line at Disneyland or Universal Studios.  There is running water, fake caverns and bridges taking you everywhere.  Plenty of tvs too but I was focused on one thing, lots of icewater and now it's time to talk about their green salsa (that happens to come for free along with chips and a yelp check in - BOOM).

In my 36 years, I have been partial to red salsa ever since I can remember.  That's only because I hadn't yet tried this one.  It's like the perfect blend of tomatillo, jalapeno and green chiles... best I've ever had.  The waiter even brought out a 2nd tub due to our inhaling it in mere moments.  So good - I can't even explain.  If you ONLY come here for the green salsa and the New Mexican potstickers you are winning at life.

I realize that maybe some of my taste buds were off due to that much day drinking, but I am convinced that whenever anything is the ""best I've ever had"" it's my duty to shout from a rooftop so my fellow friends and yelpers alike can also enjoy.  I don't remember which entree I ordered, and it was too difficult to determine what it was when I finished it off yesterday - but it was also tasty.

Since this is a vegetarian place, some background of myself would be helpful. I am not a vegetarian and I enjoy eating meat but I also enjoy eating healthy options. 

Food: 
I tried the bowls, the popular quinoa onion rings, and the veggie burger. I enjoyed the bowls, it is pack with flavour and healthiness but dont expect it to taste like a stir fry bowl cause it is not. It's a rice/noodle salad. 

As for the veggie burger, I wasn't a fan cause I had the hopes that it would taste similar to meat burgers, but my expectation was wrong. It was still a good dish but dont order it thinking it would taste like a meat burger cause that would be unfair lol. 

As for the quinoa onion ring, I didnt really understand the hype. I find regular onion rings to taste better :) and I am not sure how much nutrients are left in the quinoa after the deep frying process.

I made reservations on their website, and they responded within 2 hours about some of the details I put regarding my girlfriends food allergies, specifically dairy and tree nuts. Jennifer answered me with several very reasonable followup questions to be sure that the specifics were understood, and assured me that the chef was taking it into account. So far, so good. I email the menu to her, we both discuss the $65 four course, excitement builds.

We arrive at the place, which is an underwhelming square on the outside. We walk in and am struck by how plain things were - the plain white walls felt like the small retail store that the building was obviously intendedly sized for. An uninspired light in the middle of the building was the only attempt to change it. We stand at the front of the dining room before the waitstaff emerged from the back wall and walked the length of the room to take our names.

We are seated, and when the waitress hands us the menus, she informs my girlfriend that if she wants to have her dietary restrictions observed as had been emailed, she needed to get the tasting menu. She did use her tone to try to imply that this might be optional maybe, but her words were that the chef specifically prepared a tasting menu selection just for her. A $48 dollar up-sell using the implied threat of a deathly allergic reaction. 

She then tried to take our orders right there, on the spot. 

I had to interject into this and say that we needed a minute. She walked away, and my girlfriend immediately said how that exchange made her feel uncomfortable. I, not wanting to pay $200+ for a dinner at anywhere that thinks that sort of tactic is acceptable, agreed. The tone of the entire dinner was going to be negative. 

I can only suspect that these are hard times for notion, and the server herself was forced into using any excuse at all to sell the higher priced menu item, or had been given big financial incentives. 

Walked out and got seated at Spoon within 15 minutes. The dining room felt vibrant and well put together, with strong lighting and a vibrant minimal bar. They also have drinks and offer a prix fixe four course for $65. 

If you going to make something at this price point , then the dinning environment is not an optional bonus that you can skimp on, nor is having used car salesmen on your staff.

TO: reservations@notionresta... 
Hi Jennifer, 
I just wanted to convey my feelings on our experience at Notion tonight. After being seated, our server confirmed her food allergies... and then informed us that if she wanted to have her dietary restrictions observed, she would need to get the tastings menu. This immediately made my girlfriend uncomfortable. Instead of feeling like a luxury dinner for us, it felt like a meal that our server forced/guilted onto both of us, which is not an experience that is worth $200+. Instead, I made reservations across the street at Spoon, and we were seated 10 minutes later. 

If this restriction was really made ahead of time, then it certainly seems appropriate to have warned me in one of the 5 email we exchanged.  Cordially,

This place is a very relaxed area, with great cocktails ranging from your classic Old Fashioned to a smoked Manhattan. They also have flights of whiskey/bourbon for all whiskey lovers. I've also had difficult in finding places that can make a good cocktail and now there is finally a place nearby. They also have beer tabs on the tables! so you can self serve beer, this isn't something you see very often.

The food menu unfortunately is not that extensive, its a small list of items that is overshadowed by their great drink selections. The menu is between $5 - $10 for starters and $15 - 20 for the main. My favorite is the beef brisket, its been smoked for hours and each bite has a fantastic smoke flavor with some hints cedar. 

They also have a great chicken and waffles that everyone needs to try! It was deliciously deep fried and served with a spicy gravy and a soft crispy waffle. If you've never had chicken and waffles before, this is going to set your standards high!

It was interesting to see a bottle of Bacardi Rum sitting on the counter behind the cash register as I placed my order. I ordered a 6 pack of naked chicken tenders, a chicken cantina bowl, and a Mountain Dew. My food was ready in under a minute and it was hot and tasty. I started off with the chicken tenders. They were thin, looked like Doritos, and were very tasty, especially when dipped in the warm cheese sauce. For $1.99, this is a nice filler. My chicken bowl was fresh and tasty too. I really liked it. I added some Diablo sauce for heat. The bowl cost less than $5.00 and my entire lunch was under $9.00. That made me happy because when I dine out for lunch, I don't like to spend more than $10. My Mountain Dew was the perfect drink to wash down my yummy lunch.

I liked that they don't shoot the guacamole into the bowl with a gun. Instead, they spoon it in. This was done per the chef that invented the new dishes.

My daughter had the popcorn shrimp but the sauce was a tad pasty.  I had the burrata and tomatoes but the burrata was just too runny.  I know burrata is supposed to be a bit runny but this was too mushy as were the tomatoes.  The biggest disappointment for me was the sole and the NY Strip.  The meat was tough and not flavorful and the fish tasted more like sea bass than sole.  I know this is a harsh review but there is no way to I could put this cuisine in the same category as The Mission, Elements, Roka Akor or Cafe Monarch.

This is not a contemptuous restaurant but I just wish I had loved the food more.",1,S_Joujv7euX3N9yHqE4IMw,266287982052,563

I really, really wanted to like this place as Eric was my favourite on Master Chef Canada, but my expectation felt short. The menu is definitely unique, but it was too overhyped and the majority of dishes didn't deliver. Also, the pricing is higher compared to other restaurants in the area, so I expected the quality of food to be reflect the premium paid. The service and ambience was nice, but I would suggest R&D as a restaurant for late-night snacks and drinks, as for dinner you might leave with a high bill and an ok-full stomach. 

-Pina De Nada $7: tasted a bit watery, not much flavour going on. The tapiocas were stale and had no flavour, I think it would have been nice if they were soaked in syrup, giving it a little sweet taste. 

-Lychee Cactus Pear Juice $6: I couldn't taste the cactus nor pear flavour, and this drink reminded me of the Lychee Aloe drink that you can buy at Asian grocery stores.

-CSB (BBQ pork buns) $8: instead of the steamed CSB, these were baked. This CSB has a perfectly crispy pastry encasing the delicious and tender BBQ pork. My complaint is that my server served the last fresh batch of the buns to the table next to me, whom ordered after. Also, I didn't know these took 1 hour to be made so she should have let me know in advance. Don't tell me it will take 10-20minutes when it supposed to take 1 hour. In the end I waited 2 HOURS for the CSB....  Although these were delicious, it was $8 for only 2 buns... If they were cheaper, I would have definitely come back just for these.

-grandpa's fun guo $9: Really good, the fillings were seasoned nicely with a hint of earthiness from the truffles. 

-octopus $16: octopus pieces were grilled to perfection and wonderfully soft. The asian take on the chimichurri sauce was really good as well! It was refreshing and tangy with a hint of citrus, which brighten up the dish. By the way, I swear baked chicken skin is the new ""bacon"", you can just eat it on its own as a snack. While the octopus has little flavour, paired with the salty chicken skin and the chimichurri, it was just plain amazing. I normally don't like eggplant and for some reason I enjoyed it with this dish! The texture was almost like a mash, provided a hint of bitterness with all the components of the dish.

-beef tongue $16:I didn't enjoy this dish. For me the oysters and beef tongue didn't go well together and this dish lacked flavors. Albeit it is a bit spicy and the pickles were amazing, but the beef tongue were too dry and there wasn't enough sauce to rescue it.

-ceviche $18: I really like ceviche, but this dish didn't have that bright and refreshing taste of a ceviche. There was too much vinegar and the sauce was too creamy to enjoy.

-salmon belly $18: The salmon was really tender and flavorful, with a slight crispy skin. The rice was undercooked and cold, not warm, just stone cold... But the sauce was a bit sweet and not too salty, almost like a teriyaki sauce?

-crispy smoked milk $8: didn't enjoy it. I understand since it is smoked milk, you will definitely taste...the smoke... if you know what I mean. The smoke ""scent"" or ""taste"" was really strong that it lingers in my mouth in an unpleasant way, which gave the pastry a very bitter taste. In my opinion, if the chef used apple or other type of woods, it would have been better. The smoke will be more light and delicate, which wouldn't have overpowered the dish. The malted ice-cream and lemon zest left a refreshing aftertaste and helped to balance that bitter taste of the smoked milk.",3,xYciRtVZ1PW4IxSX4oJ1aw,283467914980,562

The ice cream was rich and sweet, which I like, and served in reasonable portions. The smoothies were thick and tasted strongly of the fruit that was supposed to be in them.

It is a newer hotel/casino on the strip and the rooms look that way, too.  For the price you pay, they are some of the larger rooms on the strip.  The Cosmopolitan charges even more money for a smaller room.  A $20 tip to the front desk attendant got us a great room with an amazing view of the strip and Treasure Island.  We got a suite with a large comfy bed and sunken living room.  All the materials looked to be high quality.  The televisions in the bathroom are pretty cool, too.  It was a very luxurious room and was a big step up after staying at the Sahara the night before (this was back in 2010).  The location is great being in the middle of the strip and the pools were amazing (you have access to the Venetian pool as well when you stay at The Palazzo, and vice versa). 

Even though this is a 5 star resort, I think the bad economy reflects the amenities and service you receive.  There wasn't as much extra attention as I would expect for a 5 star resort but they probably aren't charging the prices they used to in 2007, either.  The casino floor is very nicely decorated with non-smoking sections which is a relief.  I remember going to Vegas just a few years ago and I would feel sick and have a constantly runny nose from all the cigarette smoke.

We ordered a chicken taco salad. I asked what was in it, but the person behind the register didn't mention jalapenos. Too spicy for my child! I complained and the woman was very apologetic. I appreciated her, but what I didn't appreciate is somehow the order to remake it with a different meat did not come! I went back to the counter, and she had to ask for it again.

1- I asked for a ginger ale and a glass of water with lemon, then cancelled the ginger ale right ager saying it (I'm human, I changed my mind and apologized). He looked way too irritated for such a minor change. He proceeds to bring my water, without lemon. I said ""when you have a moment could you please bring lemon wedges for our water."" He snapped at me and was unnecessarily rude.

Aside from the amazing food, the thing that stood out to us the most at Dressler's was the amazing service. Our waiter was so helpful, thoughtful, and fast. Just a shining star in a sea of mediocre waiters. Three thumbs up.

Now back to the food.. DELICIOUS. Really though, the quality of everything was super high and fresh. Our waiter even assured us that the seafood is flown in fresh daily. I didn't have the biggest selection as a vegetarian and I mentioned this to the server AFTER our meal. He felt so bad: ""I wish you would have let me know, we have an entire vegetarian menu and gluten-free menu"". Whoa! 

I ordered the Goat Cheese & Garlic Appetizer and G's House Salad as my entree. Both of these were simple but perfect. The Goat Cheese app was very similar to my favorite goat cheese app at 300 east. The one at Dressler's differs in that it's served with a tomato chutney instead of sun-dried tomatoes... I can dig it. I ate every single bite of both my plates.

My boyfriend ordered Just for the Halibut and was blown away. I rarely see him that blissful about food, but this was one of those times. 

We ordered the Mom's Carrot Cake  to-go. I can't say it was the best carrot cake in the universe, but i was pretty close.

Yup.  Beasted this amalgamation of Hot Pastrami and Corned Beef in one sitting; this sandwich was ""My Everest"" as the wise sage Joey Tribbiani once put it.

Pretty tasty, slightly dry towards the end, but it was good enough for me to keep picking at it until I was confronted with the real thought of actually killing the whole thing.

First, understand that you're not going to see arthouse cinema or an up-and-coming foreign film at SMG. They only show the big box office blockbuster flicks. 

Before you go, navigate yourself to Groupon and pick up a few tickets for $5 apiece. Depending on the time you go, it may not be a huge savings, though -- we went to the first showing on a Sunday, for example, and only saved around $1.50 a ticket. Better than nothing. And if you don't use your Groupon before it expires, you can still use it as a coupon for the amount you paid.

This is one of those theaters where the servers come to you before and during the movie. For this reason, I would recommend against any type of film where you need to pay close attention for fear of missing details, as there may be a fair amount of distractions if your fellow moviegoers are thirsty that night. Again, shouldn't be an issue, as I've yet to see a subtle, nuanced film playing here, but it's worth noting.

The food is fine. It's more utilitarian than inspired -- think burgers and pizza (both of which come gluten free, if you'd like). It's far from gourmet, but it's good enough and the portions are generous.

I would recommend sticking with early shows, regardless of the day of the week, as the Epicentre can be a real shitshow after dark.  

On my last trip, we caught Jumanji at 11am on a Sunday and had burgers and fries. Our server was sweet and helpful, our meals arrived within the movie's first act, and theater distractions were at a minimum. This is how you do SMG.",0,0EgbVtQfdNQq3Tapxwl_sw,111669216207,518

I can't say my first impression of this place was overall positive and that impression lasted through out our entire experience spanning ever part of our visit. 

Boasting 20+ draft list was probably the most impressive thing about this place.  It was very busy on a Saturday around 6.  We found some vacant bar stools on the one end of the bar.  We quickly snagged them up and from there things progressively got worse.  The stools were in bad shape.  Ripped, wobbly, and sticky.  There was a urine smell to the place.  I can't say if it was because the bathrooms were behind us or if someone had pissed in the corner the night before.  Where ever it was coming from it was off putting.  We ordered a round of drinks once we narrowed down what they had and got the attention of the bustling bartender.  Our initial bartender was very nice but she left shortly after we got there and was replaced by who I believe was either an owner or manager combo man and women team that were not as friendly.

We were very hungry having come there not just for a drink but dinner before seeing a show up the road.  I ordered the fish tacos and my husband also got tacos.  They came out quickly and really looked great!  Until I picked them up...  Talk about using frozen fish and not getting the water out.  Water was pouring out of the tacos like a fountain.  This wasn't a drip, it was more of a pool.  I tilted my water laden taco toward the plate and watched for a minute as my taco drained onto the plate below.  Bartenders must have seen me doing this, as I had to ask for another plate, but never made one comment to me.  I was so irritated but still very hungry and did not want to send my food back based on time constraints and quite honestly I believed I would probably not receive any better food.  After I filled a whole plate with fish water I salvaged what I could from this dish and ate my meal.  It was not very good.

Bumping reggaeton with the occasional R&B notes from the cashier. I could dance. I wanted to. 

On to the tacos:
I had the Baja and Cabeza while my party had the Huitlacoche and the Octopus. 
Baja - fried haddock, milky batter with a crisp outside. Classic vegetables with the picco. Just a solid fish taco. 
Cabeza - beef head and cheek. Tender, falling apart, almost minced, deathly seasoned with probably cumin and s&p of what I can guess, but dang! So good. The cilantro added a nice contrast so that you wouldn't get overwhelmed with beef. 
Huitlacoche - corn fungus. It just shouldn't be, but it is, and it is good. Like an earthy mushroomy corn with black bean paste. Such a good bite. I wouldn't have it alone though. Not quite filling. 
Octopus - I can't remember the actual name obviously, but they charred the octopus just slightly so that it wouldn't be chewy, and you'd get the smokey flavour. 

The salsas are awesome. I used to have a high spice tolerance in high school but this far down the road, I can barely deal with some McD's spices.... still so tasty. I mixed the medium and the mild and squeezed the lime.

I asked if they could make my meal both gluten and lactose free and they happily accommodated me. They grilled my food on the other burner so they could avoid cross contamination. The teppanaki style dinners come with soup, salad, salmon fried rice, vegetables, and ice cream. Unfortunately, I couldn't eat the soup or ice cream but I gave them to other people in the groups.

During my first visit, I ordered the shrimp, chicken and scallops for dinner. The shrimp and scallops were cooked perfectly. They were extremely tender and melted in my mouth. The chicken was also really good. On my second visit I ordered the Fillet Mignon thinking I could share my steak with other family members and be able to try their meats. I didn't realize the chef had added soya sauce to their food so I wasn't able to try their meats. ***If you have a food allergy or sensitivity, make sure you choose a dinner combo that has a different cuts of protein so you can try more***. 

Allover, Everyone had a really good experience on both occasions. Everyone loved their meals and the food was prepared really well. The teppanyaki show is a little less grand than at some other restaurants (this is where they lost a star) but the food and ability to accommodate my diet made up for it.

My pal and I have started an annual tradition....1. Going to Vegas every fall and 2. Eating at a burger place the day we arrive. This year my friend's Food Network crush (come on, we all have one...) on Gordon Ramsay led us to BurGR. Hot off the plane, we headed over to Planet Hollywood.  After wandering around for awhile, unable to find BurGR, we asked someone...naturally, at that point we were practically on top of it. Duh.

After a short wait, we were seated. Our stripper I mean waitress came by and explained the menu to us. It's somewhat limited....burgers (duh #2), including chicken, pork, and portobello burgers, a couple salads, a couple hot dog choices, a fish sandwich...plus some apps, shakes, and fries. We wound up going with the Hell's Kitchen Burger and banana shake for her, and the Uber Cheese Burger (FYI, ""uber cheese"" = 3 different kinds) and chocolate shake for me. We ordered regular fries to share, which came with chipotle ketchup and curry ketchup.

The shakes arrived first...ok, there is pudding on top of them. How can that be bad? A shake and pudding combined takes care of all kinds of girl needs. We were in love.

We also really enjoyed our burgers...the meat was of excellent quality and very flavorful.  Even the bun was good. The fries, however, left something to be desired....they were not terrible, but the burgers and shakes were so fab, we felt let down. The 2 ketchups were tasty, but the fries seemed like maybe they were sitting around for awhile? Which I find hard to believe, since they must serve fries all day long. So I guess if there IS one thing Gordon Ramsay can't do...it's fries. But we got over it. 

We would surely go to BurGR again (duh #3)....I'd love to try some of the other burgers and shakes....however, we'd pass on the fries....the next table had an appetizer of onion rings, maybe we'd get those instead.
